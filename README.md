# Best Practices for Alchemical Free Energy Simulations

## Goals

- Checklist and background for new practitioners of relative and absolute alchemical free energy calculations: What should you pay attention to in setting up and running calculations in common codes and why.
- Provide guidance to authors as to what should be reported about their protocols in a Methods section, either conforming to standard or reporting where they did not conform and why. Useful to reviewers as well.


## Scope

Preparation (focused on aspects unique to alchemical free energies), execution, and analysis of:

- Transfer free energies (hydration free energies, partition coefficients, etc.)
- Binding free energies

## Paper Writing as Code Development
<!-- This discussion is so that people know how to contribute to your document. -->
This paper is being developed as a living document, open to changes from the community.
You can read more about the concept of writing a paper in the same way one would write software code in the essay ["Paper writing as code development"](https://livecomsjournal.github.io/paper_code.html).
If you have comments or suggestions, we welcome them! Please [submit them as issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) to this GitHub repository so they can be recorded and given credit for the contribution.
