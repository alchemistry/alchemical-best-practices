\section{Prerequisites}
\label{sec:pre}
Here you would identify prerequisites/background knowledge that are assumed by your work and your checklist which you view as critical, ideally giving links to good sources on these topics.
Checklists are normally focused on errors made by users with training and experience in molecular simulations, so you can assume a basic familiarity with the fundamentals of molecular simulations.

\section{Scope and Goals}
\label{sec:scope}
\begin{itemize}
\item Preparation (focused on aspects unique to alchemical free energies), execution, and analysis of:
\begin{itemize}
\item Transfer free energies (hydration free energies, partition coefficients, etc.)
\item Binding free energies
\end{itemize}
\item Not in scope:
\begin{itemize}
\item Advanced ligand binding topics such as:
\item Covalent inhibition
\item Association which is not 1:1
\item Endpoint free energy methods
\item PMF binding free energy methods
\item Force field choice: Should be a separate document (review)
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Goals:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Checklist and background for new practitioners of relative and absolute alchemical free energy calculations: What should you pay attention to in setting up and running calculations in common codes and why.
\item Provide guidance to authors as to what should be reported about their protocols in a Methods section, either conforming to standard or reporting where they did not conform and why. Useful to reviewers as well.
\end{itemize}

\section{Checklist}
\label{sec:checklist}
\todo[inline, color={green!20}]{ASJSM: @Volunteer This needs to be revised and expanded, some initial thoughts were just thrown in.}
An attempt at identifying most important checklist items. 


% This provides a checklist which
% - spans a full page
% - consists of multiple sub-checklists
% - exists on a separate page
% This style of checklist will be especially helpful if you want to encourage readers to print and use your checklist in practice, as they
% can easily print it without also printing other material from your manuscript. However, other styles of checklist are also possible (below).
\begin{Checklists*}[p!]

\begin{checklist}{Step 0 -- Know what you want to simulate }
\textbf{What are the first questions that need addressing before setting up a molecular dynamics simulation}\\
Extensive explanation for the checklist questions can be found in section~\ref{sec:step0}.
\begin{itemize}
\item Can I get the required accuracy with the simulation I want to carry out
\item 
\item And finally
\end{itemize}
\end{checklist}

\begin{checklist}{Simulation preparation}
\textbf{How do I get started setting up an alchemical free energy calculation}
Extensive explanation for the checklist questions can be found in section~\ref{sec:step1}.
\begin{itemize}
\item Have I followed the Best practices for biomolecular simulation set up?
\item In a relative simulation, will I run into problems with clashing geometries in the ligand transformation or crystal waters?
\end{itemize}
\end{checklist}
\end{Checklists*}

\begin{Checklists*}[p!]
\begin{checklist}{Absolute simulations}
\textbf{What are the main things I need to consider for an absolute alchemical free energy calculation?}
Extensive explanation for the checklist questions can be found in section~\ref{sec:step2}.
\begin{itemize}
\item Topology
\item Restraints
\item Standard state handling
\end{itemize}
\end{checklist}

\begin{checklist}{Relative simulations}
\textbf{What are the main things I need to consider for an relative alchemical free energy calculation?}
Extensive explanation for the checklist questions can be found in section~\ref{sec:step2}.
\begin{itemize}
\item First thing
\item Also remember
\item And finally
\end{itemize}
\end{checklist}

\begin{checklist}{Analysis}
\textbf{This is all about analysis of the simulation}
Extensive explanation for the checklist questions can be found in section~\ref{sec:step4}.
\begin{itemize}
\item Are my simulations converged enough?
\item Am I using the right analysis techniques?
\end{itemize}
\end{checklist}

\end{Checklists*}
\clearpage

\section{Step 0 -- What can be expected from alchemical simulations?}
\label{sec:step0}
\begin{itemize}
\item What level of accuracy you can expect? 
\item What timescales and how many transformations can you address given available computational resources? 
\item Can you even hope to tackle the problem you are attempting? 
\end{itemize}

\section{Step 1 -- Simulation prerequesites}
\label{sec:step1}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Generate geometry of initial state: Reference biomolecular simulation preparation best practices
\item Relative: Generate geometry of final state (Mey)
\begin{itemize}
\item e.g. ligand ideally shouldn’t clash with receptor, etc.; satisfy constraints that might be imposed by protocol such as overlapping atoms, etc.
\item reference biomolecular preparation setup practices for placing ligand into binding site, but elaborate on constraints that must be considered for relative free energy calculations
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Step 2 -- Simulation protocol selection}
\label{sec:step2}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Relative: Select a topology and produce an atom mapping for transformation (Mobley)
\begin{itemize}
\item Watching out for constraints to bonds for hydrogen: these cannot be allowed to change without including Jacobian terms
\item Share atoms between initial and final ligands if possible, otherwise colocalize pair of compounds and exclude their interactions with one another
\item Ring breaking/forming: Special are is needed; cite references
\item Tools: enlist Hannes Loeffler (developer of FESetup)?
\item Clarify terminology: Dual-topology, single-topology, etc.
\end{itemize}

\item Absolute: Identify \textbf{restraints and standard state handling}
\begin{itemize}
\item Practical use of Boresch restraints/other forms of restraints. How to choose atoms involved. etc. (e.g. see Heinzelmann/Gilson BRD4 work; Chodera also has stuff to add)
\item Levi Naden: Problems with analytical approximation to standard-state correction for Boresch restraints
\item Harmonic and flat-bottom restraints
\item Clarify terminology: Double decoupling, etc. See Feature Box below.
\end{itemize}
\item Identify whether \textbf{net charge is changing }and how this will be handled:
Issues that still need to be resolved: Charge corrections vs alchemically modify counterions

\item Select an \textbf{alchemical pathway}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Choice of alchemical Hamiltonian
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Softcore potentials are always recommended, but might not ALWAYS be necessary, e.g.:
	\item Pure changes in parameters of atoms that don’t insert/delete atoms (turn into dummies/from dummies)
	\item If roughly isosteric (e.g. lambda dynamics work from C. Brooks)
	\end{itemize}
\item Choice of discrete alchemical protocol (Shirts, Mey, Chodera)
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Many options: Adaptive scheme, Chebyshev polynomials, linear spacing, “choose your next lambda from data at this lambda”, optimal thermodynamic length approaches (separately: Shirts, Sivak, Huafeng Xu).
	\item Levi Naden had paper with lambda protocol which worked for all cases -- methane solvation, host-guest (including disappearing host)
	\end{itemize}
\item Relative
Three-stage protocol (discharge unique initial atoms, transform LJ, charge unique final atoms) vs softcore electrostatics/LJ

\item Absolute
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Select a \textbf{common alchemically-eliminated end state}
	\item Decoupled vs annihilated for electrostatics and LJ
	\item Sequential electrostatics and LJ versus simultaneous (recommend sequential)

\end{itemize}
\item Concerns:
Part of AMBER still can’t run at endpoints (lambda = 0 or 1); SANDER cannot but PMEMD can.

\end{enumerate}

\item Determine whether you need to \textbf{handle multiple binding modes}: (Mobley)
\begin{itemize}
\item In absolute: Confine-and-release, BLUES
\item In relative (ugh!!)
\end{itemize}
\item Determine \textbf{stopping conditions}
Uncertainty-directed stopping criteria can ensure target uncertainty is achieved


\item Select which \textbf{data should be saved and with which frequency}
\begin{itemize}
\item What data to save: dU/dlambda, Delta E’s between neighbor for BAR, between further for MBAR, …
\item BAR captures most of info with well-optimized lambda protocol, but MBAR when perhaps not, except when there are way too many lambda values.
\item Recommend against solely relying on TI when possible 
\item Recommend cross-comparing methods (TI (spline, trapezoid, etc.), BAR, MBAR) as diagnosis of trouble
\end{itemize}

\end{enumerate}

\section{Step 3 -- Overview of available analysis techniques}
\label{sec:step3}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Detecting boundary between equilibrated and production regions (Chodera: \url{http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.5b00784})
\item Decorrelating samples for analysis
\begin{itemize}
\item Subsample different lambdas based on correlation times
\item Ensure all simulations at least 50x correlation time
\end{itemize}
\item Examining output data for common problems with discussions of what exactly to plot or look at; examples of typical curves for dV/dlambda and free energy versus lambda, for example
\begin{itemize}
\item Make sure ligand doesn’t tumble out of binding site (Mey has observed this)
\item Significant discrepancies between different free energy estimators (TI, BAR, MBAR)
\item Poor replica mixing (for replica-exchange)
\item Correlation time as a function of lambda as it would be expected to be a smooth
\item Dependence on initial conformation
\item Torsional analysis: Is it stuck in specific states? Only very rarely transitions?
\item More “usual suspects”
\end{itemize}
\item Estimators for free energies
\begin{itemize}
\item MBAR recommended if all energy differences are available
\item BAR just as good for highly optimized lambda values
\item TI should be roughly concordant, but quadrature error hard to quantify
\item Other variants useful in special circumstances (e.g. Z. Tan stochastic version)
\end{itemize}
\item Computing and reporting uncertainties on free energies
correlated bootstrap v. timeseries analysis
\item Other considerations for many transformations
Cycle closure error



\end{enumerate}
