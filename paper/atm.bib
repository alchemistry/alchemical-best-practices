                  processes requires at its very core the knowledge of
                  the underlying free-energy change. In computer-aided
                  drug design, for instance, such processes as binding
                  of a drug to a protein or its spontaneous
                  partitioning across the cell membrane cannot be
                  predicted reliably without considering how the
                  associated free energy varies. Owing to relentless
                  theoretical developments, which have benefited from
                  ever-growing computational resources, free-energy
                  calculations leaning on statistical-mechanics
                  simulations are now part of the arsenal of robust

                  to obtain accurate and reliable free-energy
                  predictions for biomolecules due to the many nuances
                  in the system setup and the unknown unknowns such as
                  whether a given simulation is globally converged or
                  only locally converged, perhaps in an incorrect

abstract  = {We apply the Alchemical Transfer Method (ATM) and a bespoke fixed partial charge force field to the SAMPL9 bCD host–guest binding free energy prediction challenge that comprises a combination of complexes formed between five phenothiazine guests and two cyclodextrin hosts. Multiple chemical forms{,} competing binding poses{,} and computational modeling challenges pose significant obstacles to obtaining reliable computational predictions for these systems. The phenothiazine guests exist in solution as racemic mixtures of enantiomers related by nitrogen inversions that bind the hosts in various binding poses{,} each requiring an individual free energy analysis. Due to the large size of the guests and the conformational reorganization of the hosts{,} which prevent a direct absolute binding free energy route{,} binding free energies are obtained by a series of absolute and relative binding alchemical steps for each chemical species in each binding pose. Metadynamics-accelerated conformational sampling was found to be necessary to address the poor convergence of some numerical estimates affected by conformational trapping. Despite these challenges{,} our blinded predictions quantitatively reproduced the experimental affinities for the β-cyclodextrin host and{,} to a lesser extent{,} those with a methylated derivative. The work illustrates the challenges of obtaining reliable free energy data in in silico drug design for even seemingly simple systems and introduces some of the technologies available to tackle them.}

    We present receptor hopping and receptor swapping free energy estimation protocols based on the Alchemical Transfer Method (ATM) to model the binding selectivity of a set of ligands to two arbitrary receptors. The receptor hopping protocol, where a ligand is alchemically transferred from one receptor to another in one simulation, directly yields the ligand’s binding selectivity free energy (BSFE) for the two receptors, which is the difference between the two individual binding free energies. In the receptor swapping protocol, the first ligand of a pair is transferred from one receptor to another while the second ligand is simultaneously transferred in the opposite direction. The receptor swapping free energy yields the differences in binding selectivity free energies of a set of ligands, which, when combined using a generalized DiffNet algorithm, yield the binding selectivity free energies of the ligands. We test these algorithms on host–guest systems and show that they yield results that agree with experimental data and are consistent with differences in absolute and relative binding free energies obtained by conventional methods. Preliminary applications to the selectivity analysis of molecular fragments binding to the trypsin and thrombin serine protease confirm the potential of the receptor swapping technology in structure-based drug discovery. The novel methodologies presented in this work are a first step toward streamlined and computationally efficient protocols for ligand selectivity optimization between mutants and homologous proteins.

  abstract = {
    We present the Alchemical Transfer with Coordinate Swapping (ATS) method to enable the calculation of the relative binding free energies between large congeneric ligands and single-point mutant peptides to protein receptors with the Alchemical Transfer Method (ATM) framework. Similarly to ATM, the new method implements the alchemical transformation as a coordinate transformation and works with any unmodified force fields and standard chemical topologies. Unlike ATM, which transfers whole ligands in and out of the receptor binding site, ATS limits the magnitude of the alchemical perturbation by transferring only the portion of the molecules that differ between the bound and unbound ligands. The common region of the two ligands, which can be arbitrarily large, is unchanged and does not contribute to the magnitude and statistical fluctuations of the perturbation energy. Internally, the coordinates of the atoms of the common regions are swapped to maintain the integrity of the covalent bonding data structures of the OpenMM molecular dynamics engine. The work successfully validates the method on protein–ligand and protein-peptide RBFE benchmarks. This advance paves the road for the application of the relative binding free energy Alchemical Transfer Method protocol to study the effect of protein and nucleic acid mutations on the binding affinity and specificity of macromolecular complexes.
