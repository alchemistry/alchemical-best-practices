abstract  ="The purpose of statistical mechanics is to provide a route to the calculation of macroscopic properties of matter from their constituent microscopic components. It is well known that the macrostates emerge as ensemble averages of microstates. However{,} this is more often stated than implemented in computer simulation studies. Here we consider foundational aspects of statistical mechanics which are overlooked in most textbooks and research articles that purport to compute macroscopic behaviour from microscopic descriptions based on classical mechanics and show how due attention to these issues leads in directions which have not been widely appreciated in the field of molecular dynamics simulation."}

    abstract = { Molecular dynamics simulation is now a widespread approach for understanding complex systems on the atomistic scale. It finds applications from physics and chemistry to engineering, life and medical science. In the last decade, the approach has begun to advance from being a computer-based means of rationalizing experimental observations to producing apparently credible predictions for a number of real-world applications within industrial sectors such as advanced materials and drug discovery. However, key aspects concerning the reproducibility of the method have not kept pace with the speed of its uptake in the scientific community. Here, we present a discussion of uncertainty quantification for molecular dynamics simulation designed to endow the method with better error estimates that will enable it to be used to report actionable results. The approach adopted is a standard one in the field of uncertainty quantification, namely using ensemble methods, in which a sufficiently large number of replicas are run concurrently, from which reliable statistics can be extracted. Indeed, because molecular dynamics is intrinsically chaotic, the need to use ensemble methods is fundamental and holds regardless of the duration of the simulations performed. We discuss the approach and illustrate it in a range of applications from materials science to ligand–protein binding free energy estimation. This article is part of the theme issue ‘Reliability and reproducibility in computational science: implementing verification, validation and uncertainty quantification in silico’. }

abstract = {Abstract A systematic and statistically robust protocol is applied for the evaluation of free energy calculations with and without replica-exchange. The protocol is based on ensemble averaging to generate accurate assessments of the uncertainties in the predictions. Comparison is made between FEP+ and TIES—free energy perturbation and thermodynamic integration with enhanced sampling—the latter with and without the so-called “enhanced sampling” based on replica-exchange protocols. Standard TIES performs best for a reference set of targets and compounds; no benefits accrue from replica-exchange methods. Evaluation of FEP+ and TIES with REST—replica-exchange with solute tempering—reveals a systematic and significant underestimation of free energy differences in FEP+, which becomes increasingly large for long duration simulations, is confirmed by extensive analysis of previous publications, and raises a number of questions pertaining to the accuracy of the predictions with the REST technique not hitherto discussed.},

abstract = {We apply a free energy perturbation simulation method, free energy perturbation/replica exchange with solute tempering, to two modifications of protein–ligand complexes that lead to significant conformational changes, the first in the protein and the second in the ligand. The approach is shown to facilitate sampling in these challenging cases where high free energy barriers separate the initial and final conformations and leads to superior convergence of the free energy as demonstrated both by consistency of the results (independence from the starting conformation) and agreement with experimental binding affinity data. The second case, consisting of two neutral thrombin ligands that are taken from a recent medicinal chemistry program for this interesting pharmaceutical target, is of particular significance in that it demonstrates that good results can be obtained for large, complex ligands, as opposed to relatively simple model systems. To achieve quantitative agreement with experiment in the thrombin case, a next generation force field, Optimized Potentials for Liquid Simulations 2.0, is required, which provides superior charges and torsional parameters as compared to earlier alternatives.}}
