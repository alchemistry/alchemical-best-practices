  abstract = {ConspectusA principal goal of drug discovery project is to design molecules that can tightly and selectively bind to the target protein receptor. Accurate prediction of protein\textendash ligand binding free energies is therefore of central importance in computational chemistry and computer aided drug design. Multiple recent improvements in computing power, classical force field accuracy, enhanced sampling methods, and simulation setup have enabled accurate and reliable calculations of protein\textendash ligands binding free energies, and position free energy calculations to play a guiding role in small molecule drug discovery. In this Account, we outline the relevant methodological advances, including the REST2 (Replica Exchange with Solute Temperting) enhanced sampling, the incorporation of REST2 sampling with convential FEP (Free Energy Perturbation) through FEP/REST, the OPLS3 force field, and the advanced simulation setup that constitute our FEP+ approach, followed by the presentation of extensive comparisons with experiment, demonstrating sufficient accuracy in potency prediction (better than 1 kcal/mol) to substantially impact lead optimization campaigns. The limitations of the current FEP+ implementation and best practices in drug discovery applications are also discussed followed by the future methodology development plans to address those limitations. We then report results from a recent drug discovery project, in which several thousand FEP+ calculations were successfully deployed to simultaneously optimize potency, selectivity, and solubility, illustrating the power of the approach to solve challenging drug design problems.The capabilities of free energy calculations to accurately predict potency and selectivity have led to the advance of ongoing drug discovery projects, in challenging situations where alternative approaches would have great difficulties. The ability to effectively carry out projects evaluating tens of thousands, or hundreds of thousands, of proposed drug candidates, is potentially transformative in enabling hard to drug targets to be attacked, and in facilitating the development of superior compounds, in various dimensions, for a wide range of targets. More effective integration of FEP+ calculations into the drug discovery process will ensure that the results are deployed in an optimal fashion for yielding the best possible compounds entering the clinic; this is where the greatest payoff is in the exploitation of computer driven design capabilities.A key conclusion from the work described is the surprisingly robust and accurate results that are attainable within the conventional classical simulation, fixed charge paradigm. No doubt there are individual cases that would benefit from a more sophisticated energy model or dynamical treatment, and properties other than protein\textendash ligand binding energies may be more sensitive to these approximations. We conclude that an inflection point in the ability of MD simulations to impact drug discovery has now been attained, due to the confluence of hardware and software development along with the formulation of ``good enough'' theoretical methods and models.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Alchemical free energy calculations are now widely used to drive or maintain potency in small molecule lead optimization with a roughly 1 kcal/mol accuracy. Despite this, the potential to use free energy calculations to drive optimization of compound selectivity among two similar targets has been relatively unexplored in published studies. In the most optimistic scenario, the similarity of binding sites might lead to a fortuitous cancellation of errors and allow selectivity to be predicted more accurately than affinity. Here, we assess the accuracy with which selectivity can be predicted in the context of small molecule kinase inhibitors, considering the very similar binding sites of human kinases CDK2 and CDK9, as well as another series of ligands attempting to achieve selectivity between the more distantly related kinases CDK2 and ERK2. Using a Bayesian analysis approach, we separate systematic from statistical error and quantify the correlation in systematic errors between selectivity targets. We find that, in the CDK2/CDK9 case, a high correlation in systematic errors suggests free energy calculations can have significant impact in aiding chemists in achieving selectivity, while in more distantly related kinases (CDK2/ERK2), the correlation in systematic error suggests fortuitous cancellation may even occur between systems that are not as closely related. In both cases, the correlation in systematic error suggests that longer simulations are beneficial to properly balance statistical error with systematic error to take full advantage of the increase in apparent free energy calculation accuracy in selectivity prediction.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Despite good progress, the required accuracy for use in a drug-discovery context has not been consistently achieved for drug-like molecules. Here, we perform absolute free energy calculations based on a thermodynamic cycle for a set of diverse inhibitors binding to bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) and demonstrate that a mean absolute error of 0.6 kcal mol-1 can be achieved. We also show a similar level of accuracy (1.0 kcal mol-1) can be achieved in pseudo prospective approach. Bromodomains are epigenetic mark readers that recognize acetylation motifs and regulate gene transcription, and are currently being investigated as therapeutic targets for cancer and inflammation. The unprecedented accuracy offers the exciting prospect that the binding free energy of drug-like compounds can be predicted for pharmacologically relevant targets.},

  abstract = {Binding selectivity is a requirement for the development of a safe drug, and it is a critical property for chemical probes used in preclinical target validation. Engineering selectivity adds considerable complexity to the rational design of new drugs, as it involves the optimization of multiple binding affinities. Computationally, the prediction of binding selectivity is a challenge, and generally applicable methodologies are still not available to the computational and medicinal chemistry communities. Absolute binding free energy calculations based on alchemical pathways provide a rigorous framework for affinity predictions and could thus offer a general approach to the problem. We evaluated the performance of free energy calculations based on molecular dynamics for the prediction of selectivity by estimating the affinity profile of three bromodomain inhibitors across multiple bromodomain families, and by comparing the results to isothermal titration calorimetry data. Two case studies were considered. In the first one, the affinities of two similar ligands for seven bromodomains were calculated and returned excellent agreement with experiment (mean unsigned error of 0.81 kcal/mol and Pearson correlation of 0.75). In this test case, we also show how the preferred binding orientation of a ligand for different proteins can be estimated via free energy calculations. In the second case, the affinities of a broad-spectrum inhibitor for 22 bromodomains were calculated and returned a more modest accuracy (mean unsigned error of 1.76 kcal/mol and Pearson correlation of 0.48); however, the reparametrization of a sulfonamide moiety improved the agreement with experiment.},

Due to the weakly binding nature of fragments, this has proven to be a challenging task, despite recent advancements in leveraging experimental and computational methods. In this work, we evaluate the use of Absolute Binding Free Energy (ABFE) calculations in guiding fragment optimisation decisions, retrospectively calculating binding free energies for 59 ligands across 4 fragment elaboration campaigns. We first demonstrate that ABFEs can be used to accurately rank fragment-sized binders with an overall Spearman's r of 0.89 and a Kendall {$\tau$} of 0.67, although often deviating from experiment in absolute free energy values with an RMSE of 2.75\,kcal/mol. We then also show that in several cases, retrospective fragment optimisation decisions can be supported by the ABFE calculations. Comparing against cheaper endpoint methods, namely N               wat               -MM/GBSA, we find that ABFEs offer better ranking power and correlation metrics. Our results indicate that ABFE calculations can usefully guide fragment elaborations to maximise affinity.},

The ectopic activity of DOT1L, associated with the chromosomal translocation that is a universal hallmark of MLL-rearranged leukemia, is a required driver of leukemogenesis in this malignancy. Here, we present studies on the structure\textendash activity relationship of aminonucleoside-based DOT1L inhibitors. Within this series, we find that improvements in target enzyme affinity and selectivity are driven entirely by diminution of the dissociation rate constant for the enzyme\textendash inhibitor complex, leading to long residence times for the binary complex. The biochemical Ki and residence times measured for these inhibitors correlate well with their effects on intracellular H3K79 methylation and MLL-rearranged leukemic cell killing. Crystallographic studies reveal a conformational adaptation mechanism associated with high-affinity inhibitor binding and prolonged residence time; these studies also suggest that conformational adaptation likewise plays a critical role in natural ligand interactions with the enzyme, hence, facilitating enzyme turnover. These results provide critical insights into the role of conformational adaptation in the enzymatic mechanism of catalysis and in pharmacologic intervention for DOT1L and other members of this enzyme class.},

Snapshots of the configurations at the end points of the perturbation are then subjected to DFT-QM/MM single-point calculations using the B3LYP functional and a range of basis sets. The resulting quantum mechanical energies are then processed using the Zwanzig equation to give free energies incorporating electronic polarization. Our approach is conceptually simple and does not require tightly coupled QM and MM software. The method has been validated by calculating the relative free energies of hydration of methane and water and the relative free energy of binding of two inhibitors of cyclooxygenase-2. Closed thermodynamic cycles are obtained across different pathways, demonstrating the correctness of the technique, although significantly more sampling is required for the protein-ligand system. Our method offers a simple and effective way to incorporate quantum mechanical effects into computed free energies of binding.},

The method, an extension of thermodynamic integration, treats the coupling parameter {$\lambda$} as a variable in an extended Hamiltonian formulation and propagates it with the physical coordinates. In the resulting generalized ensemble, the crossing of barriers in the physical space is enhanced. The free energy difference is determined by integrating the reversible work required to move {$\lambda$} from zero (corresponding to the initial state) to one (corresponding to the final state).

Numerical fluctuations can introduce large uncertainties, limiting the domain of application of the method. The parametric energy function describing the chemical modification in the thermodynamic integration, the ``alchemical path'', determines the amplitudes of the fluctuations. In the present work, I propose a measure of the fluctuations in the thermodynamic integration and an approach to search for a parametric energy path minimizing that measure. The optimal path derived with this approach is very close to the theoretical minimum of the measure, but produces nonergodic sampling. Nevertheless, this path is used to guide the design of a practical and efficient path producing correct sampling. The convergence with this practical path is evaluated on test cases, and compares favorably with that of other methods such as power or polynomial path, soft-core van der Waals, and some other approaches presented in the literature.

The results illustrate the theoretical analysis of such terms given in the companion paper (Boresch, S.; Karplus, M. The Role of Bonded Terms in Free Energy Simulations:\, 1. Theoretical Analysis. J. Phys. Chem. A 1998, 103, 10310). Three model systems are investigated:\, (a) two one-dimensional harmonic oscillators interacting with a third particle that represents the solvent, (b) the aqueous solvation of two diatomic molecules, and (c) the aqueous solvation of ethane and methanol. In each case, the computations are carried out with both a single topology and a dual topology methodology. A comparison of free energy components of the single and double free energy differences obtained in the calculations makes it possible to identify the three contributions that the theoretical analysis showed were involved, i.e., vibrational, pmf-type, and Jacobian factor terms.The verification of the theoretical analysis by illustrative examples provides the basis for addressing the question of whether the so-called self-terms can make significant contributions to double free energy differences. This is accomplished by identifying the effect of coupling of the three contributions from bonded energy terms on a double free energy difference. For the model systems studied, coupling and, hence, self-terms are found to be of little importance. The analysis resolves the ambiguities concerning this issue in the literature.},

  abstract = {The computation of absolute binding affinities by molecular dynamics (MD) based free energy simulations is analyzed, and an exact method to carry out such a computation is presented. The key to obtaining converged results is the introduction of suitable, auxiliary restraints to prevent the ligand from leaving the binding site when the native ligand-receptor interactions are turned off alchemically. We describe a versatile set of restraints that (i) can be used in MD simulations, that (ii) restricts both the position and the orientation of the ligand, and that (iii) is defined relative to the receptor rather than relative to a fixed point in space. The free energy cost, {$\Delta$}Ar, for this set of restraints can be evaluated analytically. Although the techniques were originally developed for the gas phase, the resulting expression is exact, since all contributions from solute-solvent interactions cancel from the final result. The value of {$\Delta$}Ar depends only on the equilibrium values and force constants of the chosen harmonic restraint terms and, therefore, can be easily calculated. The standard state dependence of binding free energies is also investigated, and it is shown that the present approach takes this into account correctly. The analytical expression for {$\Delta$}Ar is verified numerically by calculations on the complex formed by benzene with the L99A mutant of T4 lysozyme. The overall approach is illustrated by a complete binding free energy calculation for a complex based on a simplified model for tyrosine bound to tyrosyl-tRNA-synthetase. The results demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed set of restraints and confirm that the calculated binding free energy is independent of the details of the restraints. Comparisons are made with earlier formulations for the calculation of binding free energies, and certain limitations of that work are described. The relationship between {$\Delta$}Ar and the loss of translational and rotational entropy during a binding process is analyzed.},

  abstract = {A congeneric series of benzamidine-type ligands with a central proline moiety and a terminal cycloalkyl group\textemdash linked by a secondary amine, ether, or methylene bridge\textemdash was synthesized as trypsin inhibitors. This series of inhibitors was investigated by isothermal titration calorimetry, crystal structure analysis in two crystal forms, and molecular dynamics simulations. Even though all of these congeneric ligands exhibited essentially the same affinity for trypsin, their binding profiles at the structural, dynamic, and thermodynamic levels are very distinct. The ligands display a pronounced enthalpy/entropy compensation that results in a nearly unchanged free energy of binding, even though individual enthalpy and entropy terms change significantly across the series. Crystal structures revealed that the secondary amine-linked analogs scatter over two distinct conformational families of binding modes that occupy either the inside or of the outside the protein's S3/S4 specificity pocket. In contrast, the ether-linked and methylene-linked ligands preferentially occupy the hydrophobic specificity pocket. This also explains why the latter ligands could only be crystallized in the conformationally restricting closed crystal form whereas the derivative with the highest residual mobility in the series escaped our attempts to crystallize it in the closed form; instead, a well-resolved structure could only be achieved in the open form with the ligand in disordered orientation. These distinct binding modes are supported by molecular dynamics simulations and correlate with the shifting enthalpic/entropic signatures of ligand binding. The examples demonstrate that, at the molecular level, binding modes and thermodynamic binding signatures can be very different even for closely related ligands. However, deviating binding profiles provide the opportunity to optimally address a given target.},

  abstract = {Computational methods to calculate ligand binding affinities are increasing in popularity, due to improvements in simulation algorithms, computational resources, and easy-to-use software. However, issues can arise in relative ligand binding free energy simulations if the ligands considered have different active site water networks, as simulations are typically performed with a predetermined number of water molecules (fixed N ensembles) in preassigned locations. If an alchemical perturbation is attempted where the change should result in a different active site water network, the water molecules may not be able to adapt appropriately within the time scales of the simulations\textemdash particularly if the active site is occluded. By combining the grand canonical ensemble ({$\mu$}VT) to sample active site water molecules, with conventional alchemical free energy methods, the water network is able to dynamically adapt to the changing ligand. We refer to this approach as grand canonical alchemical perturbation (GCAP). In this work we demonstrate GCAP for two systems; Scytalone Dehydratase (SD) and Adenosine A2A receptor. For both systems, GCAP is shown to perform well at reproducing experimental binding affinities. Calculating the relative binding affinities with a na{\"\i}ve, conventional attempt to solvate the active site illustrates how poor results can be if proper consideration of water molecules in occluded pockets is neglected. GCAP results are shown to be consistent with time-consuming double decoupling simulations. In addition, by obtaining the free energy surface for ligand perturbations, as a function of both the free energy coupling parameter and water chemical potential, it is possible to directly deconvolute the binding energetics in terms of protein\textendash ligand direct interactions and protein binding site hydration.},

In principle, molecular simulations methodologies that compute free energies of binding do capture nonadditivity of protein\textendash ligand interactions, but efficient protocols are necessary to compute well-converged free energies of binding that clearly resolve nonadditive effects. To this end, an efficient GPU-accelerated implementation of alchemical free energy calculations has been developed and applied to two congeneric series of ligands of the enzyme thrombin. The results show that accurate binding affinities are computed across the two congeneric series and positive coupling between nonpolar R1 substituents and a X = NH3+ substituent is reproduced, albeit with a weaker trend than experimentally observed. By contrast, a docking methodology completely fails to capture nonadditive effects. Further analysis shows that the nonadditive effects are partly due to variations in the strength of a hydrogen-bond between the X = NH3+ ligands family and thrombin residue Gly216. However, other partially compensating interactions occur across the entire binding site, and no single interaction dictates the magnitude of the nonadditive effects for all the analyzed protein\textendash ligand complexes.},

  abstract = {A significant challenge and potential high-value application of computer-aided drug design is the accurate prediction of protein\textendash ligand binding affinities. Free energy perturbation (FEP) using molecular dynamics (MD) sampling is among the most suitable approaches to achieve accurate binding free energy predictions, due to the rigorous statistical framework of the methodology, correct representation of the energetics, and thorough treatment of the important degrees of freedom in the system (including explicit waters). Recent advances in sampling methods and force fields coupled with vast increases in computational resources have made FEP a viable technology to drive hit-to-lead and lead optimization, allowing for more efficient cycles of medicinal chemistry and the possibility to explore much larger chemical spaces. However, previous FEP applications have focused on systems with high-resolution crystal structures of the target as starting points\textemdash something that is not always available in drug discovery projects. As such, the ability to apply FEP on homology models would greatly expand the domain of applicability of FEP in drug discovery. In this work we apply a particular implementation of FEP, called FEP+, on congeneric ligand series binding to four diverse targets: a kinase (Tyk2), an epigenetic bromodomain (BRD4), a transmembrane GPCR (A2A), and a protein\textendash protein interaction interface (BCL-2 family protein MCL-1). We apply FEP+ using both crystal structures and homology models as starting points and find that the performance using homology models is generally on a par with the results when using crystal structures. The robustness of the calculations to structural variations in the input models can likely be attributed to the conformational sampling in the molecular dynamics simulations, which allows the modeled receptor to adapt to the ``real'' conformation for each ligand in the series. This work exemplifies the advantages of using all-atom simulation methods with full system flexibility and offers promise for the general application of FEP to homology models, although additional validation studies should be performed to further understand the limitations of the method and the scenarios where FEP will work best.},

  abstract = {The use of the Zwanzig equation in the calculation of single-step perturbations to provide first-principles (ab initio) quantum mechanics (QM) correction terms to molecular mechanics (MM) free energy cycles is well established. A rigorous test of the ability to converge such calculations would be very useful in this context. In this work, we perform a direct assessment of the convergence of the MM to QM perturbation, by attempting the reverse QM to MM perturbation. This required the generation of extensive QM molecular dynamics trajectories, using density functional theory (DFT), within the representative biological system of a DNA adenosine\textendash thymidine dimer. Over 100 ps of dynamics with the PBE functional and 6.25 ps with the LDA functional were generated. We demonstrate that calculations with total potential energies are very poorly convergent due to a lack of overlap of phase space distributions between ensembles. While not theoretically rigorous, the use of interaction energies provides far superior convergence, despite the presence of nonclassical charge transfer effects within the DFT trajectories. The source of poor phase space overlap for total energies is diagnosed, the approximate quantification of overlaps suggesting that even for the comparatively simple system considered here convergence of total energy calculations within a reasonable simulation time is unfeasible.},

The hypothesis is that compounds showing a similar field point pattern are likely to bind at the same target site regardless of structure. The methodology to test this idea is illustrated using HIV NNRTI and thrombin ligands and validated across seven other targets. From the in silico comparisons of field point overlays, the experimentally observed binding poses of these ligands in their respective sites can be reproduced from pairwise comparisons.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in efficient and accurate treatment of solvent with the generalized Born approximation (GB) have made it possible to substantially refine the protein structures generated by various prediction tools through detailed molecular dynamics simulations. As demonstrated in a recent CASPR experiment, improvement can be quite reliably achieved when the initial models are sufficiently close to the native basin (e.g., 3\textendash 4 \AA{} C{$\alpha$} RMSD). A key element to effective refinement is to incorporate reliable structural information into the simulation protocol. Without intimate knowledge of the target and prediction protocol used to generate the initial structural models, it can be assumed that the regular secondary structure elements (helices and strands) and overall fold topology are largely correct to start with, such that the protocol limits itself to the scope of refinement and focuses the sampling in vicinity of the initial structure. The secondary structures can be enforced by dihedral restraints and the topology through structural contacts, implemented as either multiple pair-wise C{$\alpha$} distance restraints or a single sidechain distance matrix restraint. The restraints are weakly imposed with flat-bottom potentials to allow sufficient flexibility for structural rearrangement. Refinement is further facilitated by enhanced sampling of advanced techniques such as the replica exchange method (REX). In general, for single domain proteins of small to medium sizes, 3\textendash 5 nanoseconds of REX/GB refinement simulations appear to be sufficient for reasonable convergence. Clustering of the resulting structural ensembles can yield refined models over 1.0 \AA{} closer to the native structure in C{$\alpha$} RMSD. Substantial improvement of sidechain contacts and rotamer states can also be achieved in most cases. Additional improvement is possible with longer sampling and knowledge of the robust structural features in the initial models for a given prediction protocol. Nevertheless, limitations still exist in sampling as well as force field accuracy, manifested as difficulty in refinement of long and flexible loops.

  abstract = {In drug discovery programs, modifications that change the net charge of the ligands are often considered to improve the binding potency and solubility, or to address other ADME/Tox problems. Accurate calculation of the binding free-energy changes associated with charge-changing perturbations remains a great challenge of central importance in computational drug discovery. The finite size effects associated with periodic boundary condition and lattice summation employed in common molecular dynamics simulations introduce artifacts in the electrostatic potential energy calculations, which need to be carefully handled for accurate free-energy calculations between systems with different net charges. The salts in the buffer solution of experimental binding affinity assays also have a strong effect on the binding free energies between charged species, which further complicates the modeling of the charge-changing perturbations. Here, we extend our free-energy perturbation (FEP) algorithm, which has been extensively applied to many drug discovery programs for relative binding free-energy calculations between ligands with the same net charge (charge-conserving perturbation), to enable charge-changing perturbations. We have investigated three different approaches to correct the finite size effects and tested them on 10 protein targets and 31 charge-changing perturbations. We have found that all three methods are able to successfully eliminate the box-size dependence of calculated binding free energies associated with brute force FEP. Moreover, inclusion of salts matching the ionic strength of experimental buffer solution significantly improves the calculated binding free energies. For ligands with multiple possible protonation states, we applied the pKa correction to account for the ionization equilibrium of the ligands and the results are significantly improved. Finally, the calculated binding free energies from these methods agree with each other, and also agree well with the experimental results. The root-mean-square error between the calculated binding free energies and experimental data is 1.1 kcal/mol, which is on par with the accuracy of charge-conserving perturbations. We anticipate that the outstanding accuracy demonstrated here across a broad range of target classes may have significant implications for drug discovery projects, where charge-changing modifications must be considered.},

Here, we demonstrate how both of these classes of algorithms can be considered as special cases of Gibbs sampling within a Markov chain Monte Carlo framework. Gibbs sampling is a well-studied scheme in the field of statistical inference in which different random variables are alternately updated from conditional distributions. While the update of the conformational degrees of freedom by Metropolis Monte Carlo or molecular dynamics unavoidably generates correlated samples, we show how judicious updating of the thermodynamic state indices\textemdash corresponding to thermodynamic parameters such as temperature or alchemical coupling variables\textemdash can substantially increase mixing while still sampling from the desired distributions. We show how state update methods in common use can lead to suboptimal mixing, and present some simple, inexpensive alternatives that can increase mixing of the overall Markov chain, reducing simulation times necessary to obtain estimates of the desired precision. These improved schemes are demonstrated for several common applications, including an alchemical expanded ensemble simulation, parallel tempering, and multidimensional replica exchange umbrella sampling.},

However, these results were restricted to mutations which did not change the net charge of the side chains due to known difficulties with modeling perturbations involving a change in charge in FEP. Various methods have been proposed to address this problem. Here we apply the co-alchemical water approach to study the efficacy of FEP calculations of charge changing mutations at the protein\textendash protein interface for the antibody\textendash gp120 system investigated previously and three additional complexes. We achieve an overall root mean square error of 1.2 kcal/mol on a set of 106 cases involving a change in net charge selected by a simple suitability filter using side-chain predictions and solvent accessible surface area to be relevant to a biologic optimization project. Reasonable, although less precise, results are also obtained for the 44 more challenging mutations that involve buried residues, which may in some cases require substantial reorganization of the local protein structure, which can extend beyond the scope of a typical FEP simulation. We believe that the proposed prediction protocol will be of sufficient efficiency and accuracy to guide protein engineering projects for which optimization and/or maintenance of a high degree of binding affinity is a key objective.},

  abstract = {Accurate in silico prediction of protein\textendash ligand binding affinities has been a primary objective of structure-based drug design for decades due to the putative value it would bring to the drug discovery process. However, computational methods have historically failed to deliver value in real-world drug discovery applications due to a variety of scientific, technical, and practical challenges. Recently, a family of approaches commonly referred to as relative binding free energy (RBFE) calculations, which rely on physics-based molecular simulations and statistical mechanics, have shown promise in reliably generating accurate predictions in the context of drug discovery projects. This advance arises from accumulating developments in the underlying scientific methods (decades of research on force fields and sampling algorithms) coupled with vast increases in computational resources (graphics processing units and cloud infrastructures). Mounting evidence from retrospective validation studies, blind challenge predictions, and prospective applications suggests that RBFE simulations can now predict the affinity differences for congeneric ligands with sufficient accuracy and throughput to deliver considerable value in hit-to-lead and lead optimization efforts. Here, we present an overview of current RBFE implementations, highlighting recent advances and remaining challenges, along with examples that emphasize practical considerations for obtaining reliable RBFE results. We focus specifically on relative binding free energies because the calculations are less computationally intensive than absolute binding free energy (ABFE) calculations and map directly onto the hit-to-lead and lead optimization processes, where the prediction of relative binding energies between a reference molecule and new ideas (virtual molecules) can be used to prioritize molecules for synthesis. We describe the critical aspects of running RBFE calculations, from both theoretical and applied perspectives, using a combination of retrospective literature examples and prospective studies from drug discovery projects. This work is intended to provide a contemporary overview of the scientific, technical, and practical issues associated with running relative binding free energy simulations, with a focus on real-world drug discovery applications. We offer guidelines for improving the accuracy of RBFE simulations, especially for challenging cases, and emphasize unresolved issues that could be improved by further research in the field.},

A significant amount of effort has been dedicated to developing rapid and reliable in silico methods. However, robust assessment of their performance is still a complicated issue, as it requires a performance measure applicable in the prospective setting and more importantly a true null model that defines the expected performance of being random in an objective manner. Although many performance metrics, such as the Pearson correlation coefficient (r), mean unsigned error (MUE), and root-mean-square error (RMSE), are frequently used in the literature, a true and nontrivial null model has yet been identified. To address this problem, here we introduce an interval estimate as an additional measure, namely, the prediction interval (PI), which can be estimated from the error distribution of the predictions. The benefits of using the interval estimate are (1) it provides the uncertainty range in the predicted activities, which is important in prospective applications, and (2) a true null model with well-defined PI can be established. We provide one such example termed the Gaussian Random Affinity Model (GRAM), which is based on the empirical observation that the affinity change in a typical lead optimization effort has the tendency to distribute normally N (0, {$\sigma$}). Having an analytically defined PI that only depends on the variation in the activities, GRAM should, in principle, allow us to compare the performance of relative binding affinity prediction methods in a standard way, ultimately critical to measuring the progress made in algorithm development.},

The rapid and accurate quantification of the strength of these interactions (as measured by binding affinity) is a grand challenge of computational chemistry, surmounting which could revolutionize drug design and provide the platform for patient-specific medicine. Recent evidence suggests that molecular dynamics (MD) can achieve useful predictive accuracy ({$<$} 1 kcal/mol). For this predictive accuracy to impact clinical decision making, binding free energy computational campaigns must provide results rapidly and without loss of accuracy. This demands advances in algorithms, scalable software systems, and efficient utilization of supercomputing resources. We introduce a framework called HTBAC, designed to support accurate and scalable drug binding affinity calculations, while marshaling large simulation campaigns. We show that HTBAC supports the specification and execution of free-energy protocols at scale. This paper makes three main contributions: (1) shows the importance of adaptive execution for ensemble-based free energy protocols to improve binding affinity accuracy; (2) presents and characterizes HTBAC -- a software system that enables the scalable and adaptive execution of binding affinity protocols at scale; and (3) for a widely used free-energy protocol (TIES), shows improvements in the accuracy of simulations for a fixed amount of resource, or reduced resource consumption for a fixed accuracy as a consequence of adaptive execution.},

  abstract = {The computational prediction of relative binding free energies is a crucial goal for drug discovery, and G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are arguably the most important drug target class. However, they present increased complexity to model compared to soluble globular proteins. Despite breakthroughs, experimental X-ray crystal and cryo-EM structures are challenging to attain, meaning computational models of the receptor and ligand binding mode are sometimes necessary. This leads to uncertainty in understanding ligand\textendash protein binding induced changes such as, water positioning and displacement, side chain positioning, hydrogen bond networks, and the overall structure of the hydration shell around the ligand and protein. In other words, the very elements that define structure activity relationships (SARs) and are crucial for accurate binding free energy calculations are typically more uncertain for GPCRs. In this work we use free energy perturbation (FEP) to predict the relative binding free energies for ligands of two different GPCRs. We pinpoint the key aspects for success such as the important role of key water molecules, amino acid ionization states, and the benefit of equilibration with specific ligands. Initial calculations following typical FEP setup and execution protocols delivered no correlation with experiment, but we show how results are improved in a logical and systematic way. This approach gave, in the best cases, a coefficient of determination (R2) compared with experiment in the range of 0.6\textendash 0.9 and mean unsigned errors compared to experiment of 0.6\textendash 0.7 kcal/mol. We anticipate that our findings will be applicable to other difficult-to-model protein ligand data sets and be of wide interest for the community to continue improving FE binding energy predictions.},

  abstract = {Interest in ligand binding kinetics has been growing rapidly, as it is being discovered in more and more systems that ligand residence time is the crucial factor governing drug efficacy. Many enhanced sampling methods have been developed with the goal of predicting ligand binding rates (\$\$k\_\{\textbackslash text \{on\}\}\$\$kon) and/or ligand unbinding rates (\$\$k\_\{\textbackslash text \{off\}\}\$\$koff) through explicit simulation of ligand binding pathways, and these methods work by very different mechanisms. Although there is not yet a blind challenge for ligand binding kinetics, here we take advantage of experimental measurements and rigorously computed benchmarks to compare estimates of \$\$K\_D\$\$KDcalculated as the ratio of two rates: \$\$k\_\{\textbackslash text \{off\}\}/k\_\{\textbackslash text \{on\}\}\$\$koff/kon. These rates were determined using a new enhanced sampling method based on the weighted ensemble framework that we call ``REVO'': Reweighting of Ensembles by Variance Optimization. This is a further development of the WExplore enhanced sampling method, in which trajectory cloning and merging steps are guided not by the definition of sampling regions, but by maximizing trajectory variance. Here we obtain estimates of \$\$k\_\{\textbackslash text \{on\}\}\$\$konand \$\$k\_\{\textbackslash text \{off\}\}\$\$koffthat are consistent across multiple simulations, with an average log10-scale standard deviation of 0.28 for on-rates and 0.56 for off-rates, which is well within an order of magnitude and far better than previously observed for previous applications of the WExplore algorithm. Our rank ordering of the three host\textendash guest pairs agrees with the reference calculations, however our predicted \$\$\textbackslash Delta G\$\${$\Delta$}Gvalues were systematically lower than the reference by an average of 4.2~kcal/mol. Using tree network visualizations of the trajectories in the REVO algorithm, and conformation space networks for each system, we analyze the results of our sampling, and hypothesize sources of discrepancy between our \$\$K\_D\$\$KDvalues and the reference. We also motivate the direct inclusion of \$\$k\_\{\textbackslash text \{on\}\}\$\$konand \$\$k\_\{\textbackslash text \{off\}\}\$\$koffchallenges in future iterations of SAMPL, to further develop the field of ligand binding kinetics prediction and modeling.},

The method uses Markov state models to learn a simplified model of the simulations and decide where best to sample from, achieving a converged binding affinity in approximately one microsecond, 1 order of magnitude faster than classical sampling.

The difference in the free energy of hydration between two triosephosphate isomerase inhibitors calculated at five different ion concentrations is used as an example. We show that the free energy difference can be highly sensitive to the presence of explicit ions even in cases where the mutation itself does not involve a change in the overall charge. The effect is most significant if the molecule carries a net charge close to the site mutated. Furthermore, it is shown that the introduction of a small number of ions can lead to very severe sampling problems suggesting that in practical calculations convergence can best be achieved by incorporating either no counterions or by simulating at high ionic strength to ensure sufficient sampling of the ion distribution. \textcopyright{} 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract = {We examine methods to reweight classical molecular mechanics solvation calculations to more expensive QM/MM energy functions. We first consider the solvation free energy difference between ethane and methanol in a QM/MM Hamiltonian from configurations generated in a cheaper MM potential. The solute molecules in the QM/MM Hamiltonian are treated with B3LYP/6-31G*, and the solvent water molecules are treated classically. The free energy difference in the QM/MM Hamiltonian is estimated using Boltzmann reweighting with both the non-Boltzmann Bennett method (NBB) and the multistate Bennett acceptance ratio (MBAR), and the variance of each method is directly compared for an identical data set. For this system, MBAR-derived methods are found to produce smaller overall uncertainties than NBB-based methods. Additionally, we show that to reduce the variance in the overall free energy difference estimate in this system for a fixed amount of QM/MM calculations, the energy re-evaluations in the Boltzmann reweighting step should be concentrated on the physical MM states with the highest overlap to the QM/MM states, rather than allocated equally over all sampled MM states. We also show that reallocating the QM/MM re-evaluations can be used to diagnose poor overlap between the sampled and target state. The solvation free energies for molecules in the SAMPL4 solvation data set are also calculated in the QM/MM Hamiltonian with NBB and MBAR, and the variances are marginally smaller for MBAR. Overall, NBB and MBAR produce similar variances for systems with poor sampling efficiency, and MBAR provides smaller variances than NBB in systems with high sampling efficiency. Both NBB and MBAR converge to identical solvation free energy estimates in the QM/MM Hamiltonian, and the RMSD to experimental values for molecules in the SAMPL4 solvation data set decreases by approximately 28\% when switching from the MM Hamiltonian to the QM/MM Hamiltonian.},

A complete map of the binding sites of ibuprofen in albumin is difficult to obtain in traditional experiments, because of the structural adaptability of this protein in accommodating small ligands. In this work, we provide a set of predictions covering the geometry, affinity of binding and protonation state for the pharmaceutically most active form (S-isomer) of ibuprofen to albumin, by using absolute binding free energy calculations in combination with classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and molecular docking. The most favorable binding modes correctly reproduce several experimentally identified binding locations, which include the two Sudlow's drug sites (DS2 and DS1) and the fatty acid binding sites 6 and 2 (FA6 and FA2). Previously unknown details of the binding conformations were revealed for some of them, and formerly undetected binding modes were found in other protein sites. The calculated binding affinities exhibit trends which seem to agree with the available experimental data, and drastically degrade when the ligand is modeled in a protonated (neutral) state, indicating that ibuprofen associates with albumin preferentially in its charged form. These findings provide a detailed description of the binding of ibuprofen, help to explain a wide range of results reported in the literature in the last decades, and demonstrate the possibility of using simulation methods to predict ligand binding to albumin.},

This process has been previously hindered by inaccurate force fields or energy equations and slow computational processors; however, improved software and hardware have made this goal much more attainable.

However, to dateFEP has typically been helpful only when (1) high-quality X-ray data is available and(2) the target protein does not undergo significant conformational changes.  Also, alack of systematic studies on determining an adequate sampling time is often one ofthe primary limitations of FEP calculations. Herein, we propose a modified versionof the FEP/REST (i.e., replica exchange with solute tempering) sampling protocol,based on systematic studies on several targets by probing a large number of permutations with different sampling schemes. Improved FEP+ binding affinity predictions for regular flexible-loop (F-loop) motions and considerable structural changes can be obtained by extending the pre-REST sampling time from 0.24 ns to 5 ns/{$\lambda$}and 2\texttimes 10 ns/{$\lambda$}, respectively. We obtained much more precise {$\increment\increment$}G calculations of the individual perturbations, including the sign of the transformations and less error. We extended the REST simulations from 5 ns to 8 ns to achieve reasonable free energy convergence.Implementing REST to the entire ligand as opposed to solely the perturbed region, and also some important flexible protein residues (pREST region) in ligand binding domain (LBD) , also considerably improved the FEP+ results in most of the studied cases.  Preliminary molecular dynamics (MD) runs were useful for establishing the correct binding mode of the compounds and thus precise alignment for FEP+.},

In this search, an initial rough positioning and scoring phase that dramatically narrows the search space is followed by torsionally flexible energy optimization on an OPLS-AA nonbonded potential grid for a few hundred surviving candidate poses. The very best candidates are further refined via a Monte Carlo sampling of pose conformation; in some cases, this is crucial to obtaining an accurate docked pose. Selection of the best docked pose uses a model energy function that combines empirical and force-field-based terms. Docking accuracy is assessed by redocking ligands from 282 cocrystallized PDB complexes starting from conformationally optimized ligand geometries that bear no memory of the correctly docked pose. Errors in geometry for the top-ranked pose are less than 1 \AA{} in nearly half of the cases and are greater than 2 \AA{} in only about one-third of them. Comparisons to published data on rms deviations show that Glide is nearly twice as accurate as GOLD and more than twice as accurate as FlexX for ligands having up to 20 rotatable bonds. Glide is also found to be more accurate than the recently described Surflex method.},

This challenge was based on a dataset of structures and affinities for the nuclear receptor farnesoid X receptor (FXR), contributed by F. Hoffmann-La Roche. The dataset contained 102 IC50 values, spanning six orders of magnitude, and 36 high-resolution co-crystal structures with representatives of four major ligand classes. Strong global participation was evident, with 49 participants submitting 262 prediction submission packages in total. Procedurally, GC2 mimicked Grand Challenge 2015 (GC2015), with a Stage 1 subchallenge testing ligand pose prediction methods and ranking and scoring methods, and a Stage 2 subchallenge testing only ligand ranking and scoring methods after the release of all blinded co-crystal structures. Two smaller curated sets of 18 and 15 ligands were developed to test alchemical free energy methods. This overview summarizes all aspects of GC2, including the dataset details, challenge procedures, and participant results. We also consider implications for progress in the field, while highlighting methodological areas that merit continued development. Similar to GC2015, the outcome of GC2 underscores the pressing need for methods development in pose prediction, particularly for ligand scaffolds not currently represented in the Protein Data Bank (http://www.pdb.org), and in affinity ranking and scoring of bound ligands.},

  abstract = {The fields of rational drug design and protein engineering benefit from accurate free energy calculations based on molecular dynamics simulations. A thermodynamic integration scheme is often used to calculate changes in the free energy of a system by integrating the change of the system's Hamiltonian with respect to a coupling parameter. These methods exploit nonphysical pathways over thermodynamic cycles involving particle introduction and annihilation. Such alchemical transitions require the modification of the classical nonbonded potential energy terms by applying soft-core potential functions to avoid singularity points. In this work, we propose a novel formulation for a soft-core potential to be applied in nonequilibrium free energy calculations that alleviates singularities, numerical instabilities, and additional minima in the potential energy for all combinations of nonbonded interactions at all intermediate alchemical states. The method was validated by application to (a) the free energy calculations of a closed thermodynamic cycle, (b) the mutation influence on protein thermostability, (c) calculations of small ligand solvation free energies, and (d) the estimation of binding free energies of trypsin inhibitors. The results show that the novel soft-core function provides a robust and accurate general purpose solution to alchemical free energy calculations.},

From the different approaches available, molecular dynamics-based alchemical free energy calculations are unique in their accuracy and solid theoretical basis. The challenge in using these methods lies in the need to generate hybrid structures and topologies representing two physical states of a system. A custom made hybrid topology may prove useful for a particular mutation of interest, however, a high throughput mutation analysis calls for a more general approach. In this work, we present an automated procedure to generate hybrid structures and topologies for the amino acid mutations in all commonly used force fields. The described software is compatible with the Gromacs simulation package. The mutation libraries are readily supported for five force fields, namely Amber99SB, Amber99SB*-ILDN, OPLS-AA/L, Charmm22*, and Charmm36. \textcopyright{} 2014 The Authors Journal of Computational Chemistry Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Two targets served as the framework to test community docking and scoring methods: (1) HSP90, donated by AbbVie and the Community Structure Activity Resource (CSAR), and (2) MAP4K4, donated by Genentech. The challenges for both target datasets were conducted in two stages, with the first stage testing pose predictions and the capacity to rank compounds by affinity with minimal structural data; and the second stage testing methods for ranking compounds with knowledge of at least a subset of the ligand\textendash protein poses. An additional sub-challenge provided small groups of chemically similar HSP90 compounds amenable to alchemical calculations of relative binding free energy. Unlike previous blinded Challenges, we did not provide cognate receptors or receptors prepared with hydrogens and likewise did not require a specified crystal structure to be used for pose or affinity prediction in Stage 1. Given the freedom to select from over 200 crystal structures of HSP90 in the PDB, participants employed workflows that tested not only core docking and scoring technologies, but also methods for addressing water-mediated ligand\textendash protein interactions, binding pocket flexibility, and the optimal selection of protein structures for use in docking calculations. Nearly 40 participating groups submitted over 350 prediction sets for Grand Challenge 2015. This overview describes the datasets and the organization of the challenge components, summarizes the results across all submitted predictions, and considers broad conclusions that may be drawn from this collaborative community endeavor.},

Although several Cyp inhibitors have been reported in the literature, it has proven challenging to achieve high binding selectivity for different isoforms of this protein family. The present studies have led to the identification of several structurally novel fragments that bind to diverse Cyp isoforms in distinct pockets with low millimolar dissociation constants. A detailed comparison of the merits and drawbacks of the experimental and computational techniques is presented, and emerging strategies for designing ligands with enhanced isoform specificity are described.},

  abstract = {Accurately predicting protein\textendash ligand binding affinities and binding modes is a major goal in computational chemistry, but even the prediction of ligand binding modes in proteins poses major challenges. Here, we focus on solving the binding mode prediction problem for rigid fragments. That is, we focus on computing the dominant placement, conformation, and orientations of a relatively rigid, fragment-like ligand in a receptor, and the populations of the multiple binding modes which may be relevant. This problem is important in its own right, but is even more timely given the recent success of alchemical free energy calculations. Alchemical calculations are increasingly used to predict binding free energies of ligands to receptors. However, the accuracy of these calculations is dependent on proper sampling of the relevant ligand binding modes. Unfortunately, ligand binding modes may often be uncertain, hard to predict, and/or slow to interconvert on simulation time scales, so proper sampling with current techniques can require prohibitively long simulations. We need new methods which dramatically improve sampling of ligand binding modes. Here, we develop and apply a nonequilibrium candidate Monte Carlo (NCMC) method to improve sampling of ligand binding modes. In this technique, the ligand is rotated and subsequently allowed to relax in its new position through alchemical perturbation before accepting or rejecting the rotation and relaxation as a nonequilibrium Monte Carlo move. When applied to a T4 lysozyme model binding system, this NCMC method shows over 2 orders of magnitude improvement in binding mode sampling efficiency compared to a brute force molecular dynamics simulation. This is a first step toward applying this methodology to pharmaceutically relevant binding of fragments and, eventually, drug-like molecules. We are making this approach available via our new Binding modes of ligands using enhanced sampling (BLUES) package which is freely available on GitHub.},

  abstract = {A new method is proposed to calculate alchemical free-energy differences based on molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, called the conveyor belt thermodynamic integration (CBTI) scheme. As in thermodynamic integration (TI), K replicas of the system are simulated at different values of the alchemical coupling parameter {$\lambda$}. The number K is taken to be even, and the replicas are equally spaced on a forward-turn-backward-turn path, akin to a conveyor belt (CB) between the two physical end-states; and as in {$\lambda$}-dynamics ({$\lambda$}D), the {$\lambda$}-values associated with the individual systems evolve in time along the simulation. However, they do so in a concerted fashion, determined by the evolution of a single dynamical variable {$\Lambda$} of period 2{$\pi$} controlling the advance of the entire CB. Thus, a change of {$\Lambda$} is always associated with K/2 equispaced replicas moving forward and K/2 equispaced replicas moving backward along {$\lambda$}. As a result, the effective free-energy profile of the replica system along {$\Lambda$} is periodic of period 2{$\pi$}K\textendash 1, and the magnitude of its variations decreases rapidly upon increasing K, at least as K\textendash 1 in the limit of large K. When a sufficient number of replicas is used, these variations become small, which enables a complete and quasi-homogeneous coverage of the {$\lambda$}-range by the replica system, without application of any biasing potential. If desired, a memory-based biasing potential can still be added to further homogenize the sampling, the preoptimization of which is computationally inexpensive. The final free-energy profile along {$\lambda$} is calculated similarly to TI, by binning of the Hamiltonian {$\lambda$}-derivative as a function of {$\lambda$} considering all replicas simultaneously, followed by quadrature integration. The associated quadrature error can be kept very low owing to the continuous and quasi-homogeneous {$\lambda$}-sampling. The CBTI scheme can be viewed as a continuous/deterministic/dynamical analog of the Hamiltonian replica-exchange/permutation (HRE/HRP) schemes or as a correlated multiple-replica analog of the {$\lambda$}D or {$\lambda$}-local elevation umbrella sampling ({$\lambda$}-LEUS) schemes. Compared to TI, it shares the advantage of the latter schemes in terms of enhanced orthogonal sampling, i.e. the availability of variable-{$\lambda$} paths to circumvent conformational barriers present at specific {$\lambda$}-values. Compared to HRE/HRP, it permits a deterministic and continuous sampling of the {$\lambda$}-range, is expected to be less sensitive to possible artifacts of the thermo- and barostating schemes, and bypasses the need to carefully preselect a {$\lambda$}-ladder and a swapping-attempt frequency. Compared to {$\lambda$}-LEUS, it eliminates (or drastically reduces) the dead time associated with the preoptimization of a biasing potential. The goal of this article is to provide the mathematical/physical formulation of the proposed CBTI scheme, along with an initial application of the method to the calculation of the hydration free energy of methanol.},

Enhancements with respect to the previous version (OPLS2.1) include the addition of off-atom charge sites to represent halogen bonding and aryl nitrogen lone pairs as well as a complete refit of peptide dihedral parameters to better model the native structure of proteins. To adequately cover medicinal chemical space, OPLS3 employs over an order of magnitude more reference data and associated parameter types relative to other commonly used small molecule force fields (e.g., MMFF and OPLS\_2005). As a consequence, OPLS3 achieves a high level of accuracy across performance benchmarks that assess small molecule conformational propensities and solvation. The newly fitted peptide dihedrals lead to significant improvements in the representation of secondary structure elements in simulated peptides and native structure stability over a number of proteins. Together, the improvements made to both the small molecule and protein force field lead to a high level of accuracy in predicting protein\textendash ligand binding measured over a wide range of targets and ligands (less than 1 kcal/mol RMS error) representing a 30\% improvement over earlier variants of the OPLS force field.},

  abstract = {Bromodomains, protein domains involved in epigenetic regulation, are able to bind small molecules with high affinity. In the present study, we report free energy calculations for the binding of seven ligands to the first BRD4 bromodomain, using the attach-pull-release (APR) method to compute the reversible work of removing the ligands from the binding site and then allowing the protein to relax conformationally. We test three different water models, TIP3P, TIP4PEw, and SPC/E, as well as the GAFF and GAFF2 parameter sets for the ligands. Our simulations show that the apo crystal structure of BRD4 is only metastable, with a structural transition happening in the absence of the ligand typically after 20 ns of simulation. We compute the free energy change for this transition with a separate APR calculation on the free protein and include its contribution to the ligand binding free energies, which generally causes an underestimation of the affinities. By testing different water models and ligand parameters, we are also able to assess their influence in our results and determine which one produces the best agreement with the experimental data. Both free energies associated with the conformational change and ligand binding are affected by the choice of water model, with the two sets of ligand parameters affecting their binding free energies to a lesser degree. Across all six combinations of water model and ligand potential function, the Pearson correlation coefficients between calculated and experimental binding free energies range from 0.55 to 0.83, and the root-mean-square errors range from 1.4\textendash 3.2 kcal/mol. The current protocol also yields encouraging preliminary results when used to assess the relative stability of ligand poses generated by docking or other methods, as illustrated for two different ligands. Our method takes advantage of the high performance provided by graphics processing units and can readily be applied to other ligands as well as other protein systems.},

The corresponding reduction in binding free energy ({$\Delta\Delta$}G) of 10.1 kcal/mol was nearly completely due to binding enthalpy losses at this temperature. The loss of binding affinity is 11-fold greater than that predicted by a linear combination of the single-mutant energetic perturbations (8.7 kcal/mol), indicating that these two mutations interact cooperatively. Crystallographic characterization of the double mutant and comparison with the two single mutant structures suggest that structural rearrangements at the S45 position, when the D128 carboxylate is removed, mask the true energetic contribution of the D128\textendash biotin interaction. Taken together, the thermodynamic and structural analyses support the conclusion that the wild-type hydrogen bond between D128\textendash OD and biotin\textendash N2 is thermodynamically stronger than that between S45\textendash OG and biotin\textendash N1.},

  abstract = {Determining the net charge and protonation states populated by a small molecule in an environment of interest or the cost of altering those protonation states upon transfer to another environment is a prerequisite for predicting its physicochemical and pharmaceutical properties. The environment of interest can be aqueous, an organic solvent, a protein binding site, or a lipid bilayer. Predicting the protonation state of a small molecule is essential to predicting its interactions with biological macromolecules using computational models. Incorrectly modeling the dominant protonation state, shifts in dominant protonation state, or the population of significant mixtures of protonation states can lead to large modeling errors that degrade the accuracy of physical modeling. Low accuracy hinders the use of physical modeling approaches for molecular design. For small molecules, the acid dissociation constant (pKa) is the primary quantity needed to determine the ionic states populated by a molecule in an aqueous solution at a given pH. As a part of SAMPL6 community challenge, we organized a blind pKa prediction component to assess the accuracy with which contemporary pKa prediction methods can predict this quantity, with the ultimate aim of assessing the expected impact on modeling errors this would induce. While a multitude of approaches for predicting pKa values currently exist, predicting the pKas of drug-like molecules can be difficult due to challenging properties such as multiple titratable sites, heterocycles, and tautomerization. For this challenge, we focused on set of 24 small molecules selected to resemble selective kinase inhibitors\textemdash an important class of therapeutics replete with titratable moieties. Using a Sirius T3 instrument that performs automated acid\textendash base titrations, we used UV absorbance-based pKa measurements to construct a high-quality experimental reference dataset of macroscopic pKas for the evaluation of computational pKa prediction methodologies that was utilized in the SAMPL6 pKa challenge. For several compounds in which the microscopic protonation states associated with macroscopic pKas were ambiguous, we performed follow-up NMR experiments to disambiguate the microstates involved in the transition. This dataset provides a useful standard benchmark dataset for the evaluation of pKa prediction methodologies on kinase inhibitor-like compounds.},

  abstract = {The process of ligand binding to a biological target can be represented as the equilibrium between the relevant solvated and bound states of the ligand. This which is the basis of structure-based, rigorous methods such as the estimation of relative binding affinities by free energy perturbation (FEP). Despite the growing capacity of computing power and the development of more accurate force fields, a high throughput application of FEP is currently hampered due to the need, in the current schemes, of an expert user definition of the ``alchemical'' transformations between molecules in the series explored.

This which is the basis of structure-based, rigorous methods such as the estimation of relative binding affinities by free energy perturbation (FEP).

  abstract = {Free Energy Perturbation with Replica Exchange Molecular Dynamics (FEP/REMD) offers a powerful strategy to improve the convergence of free energy computations. In particular, it has been shown previously that a FEP/REMD scheme allowing random moves within an extended replica ensemble of thermodynamic coupling parameters ``{$\lambda$}'' can improve the statistical convergence in calculations of absolute binding free energy of ligands to proteins [J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2009, 5, 2583]. In the present study, FEP/REMD is extended and combined with an accelerated MD simulations method based on Hamiltonian replica-exchange MD (H-REMD) to overcome the additional problems arising from the existence of kinetically trapped conformations within the protein receptor. In the combined strategy, each system with a given thermodynamic coupling factor {$\lambda$} in the extended ensemble is further coupled with a set of replicas evolving on a biased energy surface with boosting potentials used to accelerate the interconversion among different rotameric states of the side chains in the neighborhood of the binding site. Exchanges are allowed to occur alternatively along the axes corresponding to the thermodynamic coupling parameter {$\lambda$} and the boosting potential, in an extended dual array of coupled {$\lambda$}- and H-REMD simulations. The method is implemented on the basis of new extensions to the REPDSTR module of the biomolecular simulation program CHARMM. As an illustrative example, the absolute binding free energy of p-xylene to the nonpolar cavity of the L99A mutant of the T4 lysozyme was calculated. The tests demonstrate that the dual {$\lambda$}-REMD and H-REMD simulation scheme greatly accelerates the configurational sampling of the rotameric states of the side chains around the binding pocket, thereby improving the convergence of the FEP computations.},

  abstract = {An effective hybrid single-dual-topology protocol is designed for the calculation of relative binding affinities of small ligands to a receptor. The protocol was developed as an extension of the NAMD molecular dynamics program, which exclusively supports a dual-topology framework for relative alchemical free-energy perturbation (FEP) calculations. In this protocol, the alchemical end states are represented as two separate molecules sharing a common substructure identified through maximum structural mapping. Within the substructure, an atom-to-atom correspondence is established, and each pair of corresponding atoms is holonomically constrained to share identical coordinates at all time throughout the simulation. The forces are projected and combined at each step for propagation. Following this formulation, a set of illustrative calculations of reliable experiment/simulation data, including relative solvation free energies of small molecules and relative binding affinities of drug compounds to proteins, are presented. To enhance sampling of the dual-topology region, the FEP calculations were carried out within a replica-exchange MD scheme supported by the multiple-copy algorithm module of NAMD, with periodically attempted swapping of the thermodynamic coupling parameter {$\lambda$} between neighboring states. The results are consistent with experiments and benchmarks reported in the literature, lending support to the validity of the current protocol. In summary, this hybrid single-dual-topology approach combines the conceptual simplicity of the dual-topology paradigm with the advantageous sampling efficiency of the single-topology approach, making it an ideal strategy for high-throughput in silico drug design.},

The use of rapid pairwise alignment algorithms in conjunction with rigid conformer libraries has become a prevalent approach to this problem. These programs can be easily used to compare two molecules or suggest alternatives to a single known active. However, it is not obvious how to combine pairwise alignments between multiple actives into an overlay that reproduces the binding mode of those actives in the target receptor. We describe a new algorithm, DIFGAPE (DIstance geometry Focused Genetic Algorithm Pose Evaluator) that, given pairwise alignments of conformers of active compounds, attempts to reproduce overlays of ligand binding modes. The software was evaluated on 13 test systems from 9 protein targets using associated ligands extracted from the PDB. Starting from 2D ligand structures with no protein information, we were able in 4 systems to approximate the crystallographically observed binding mode. For example, the prediction for a set of 11 ligands targeting FXa had 1.6 \AA{} rmsd to crystal structure coordinates. Finally, the evaluation illustrated current challenges for molecular conformer generators and pairwise alignment algorithms.},

  abstract = {With today's available computer power, free energy calculations from equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations ``via counting'' become feasible for an increasing number of reactions. An example is the dimerization reaction of transmembrane alpha-helices. If an extended simulation of the two helices covers sufficiently many dimerization and dissociation events, their binding free energy is readily derived from the fraction of time during which the two helices are observed in dimeric form. Exactly how the correct value for the free energy is to be calculated, however, is unclear, and indeed several different and contradictory approaches have been used. In particular, results obtained via Boltzmann statistics differ from those determined via the law of mass action. Here, we develop a theory that resolves this discrepancy. We show that for simulation systems containing two molecules, the dimerization free energy is given by a formula of the form {$\Delta$}G {$\propto$} ln(P1/P0). Our theory is also applicable to high concentrations that typically have to be used in molecular dynamics simulations to keep the simulation system small, where the textbook dilute approximations fail. It also covers simulations with an arbitrary number of monomers and dimers and provides rigorous error estimates. Comparison with test simulations of a simple Lennard Jones system with various particle numbers as well as with reference free energy values obtained from radial distribution functions show full agreement for both binding free energies and dimerization statistics. \textcopyright{} 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract = {Although calculations of free energy using molecular dynamics simulations have gained significant importance in the chemical and biochemical fields, they still remain quite computationally intensive. Furthermore, when using thermodynamic integration, numerical evaluation of the integral of the Hamiltonian with respect to the coupling parameter may introduce unwanted errors in the free energy. In this paper, we compare the performance of two numerical integration techniques-the trapezoidal and Simpson's rules and propose a new method, based on the analytic integration of physically based fitting functions that are able to accurately describe the behavior of the data. We develop and test our methodology by performing detailed studies on two prototype systems, hydrated methane and hydrated methanol, and treat Lennard-Jones and electrostatic contributions separately. We conclude that the widely used trapezoidal rule may introduce systematic errors in the calculation, but these errors are reduced if Simpson's rule is employed, at least for the electrostatic component. Furthermore, by fitting thermodynamic integration data, we are able to obtain precise free energy estimates using significantly fewer data points (5 intermediate states for the electrostatic component and 11 for the Lennard-Jones term), thus significantly decreasing the associated computational cost. Our method and improved protocol were successfully validated by computing the free energy of more complex systems hydration of 2-methylbutanol and of 4-nitrophenol-thus paving the way for widespread use in solvation free energy calculations of drug molecules.},

This strategy is called ``similarity-based docking''. For this purpose, we develop the flexible alignment program fkcombu, which aligns the target molecule based on atomic correspondences with the reference molecule. The correspondences are obtained by the maximum common substructure (MCS) of 2D chemical structures, using our program kcombu. The prediction performance was evaluated using many target-reference pairs of superimposed ligand 3D structures on the same protein in the PDB, with different ranges of chemical similarity. The details of atomic correspondence largely affected the prediction success. We found that topologically constrained disconnected MCS (TD-MCS) with the simple element-based atomic classification provides the best prediction. The crashing potential energy with the receptor protein improved the performance. We also found that the RMSD between the predicted and correct target conformations significantly correlates with the chemical similarities between target-reference molecules. Generally speaking, if the reference and target compounds have more than 70\% chemical similarity, then the average RMSD of 3D conformations is {$<$}2.0 \AA. We compared the performance with a rigid-body molecular alignment program based on volume-overlap scores (ShaEP). Our MCS-based flexible alignment program performed better than the rigid-body alignment program, especially when the target and reference molecules were sufficiently similar.},

The correlation between the predicted activity from the FEP calculations and the experimental activity was good for the P3 pocket substituents. The average mean unsigned error (MUE) between prediction and experiment was 0.68 {$\pm$} 0.17 kcal/mol for the default 5 ns lambda window simulation time improving to 0.35 {$\pm$} 0.13 kcal/mol for 40 ns. FEP calculations for the P2{${'}$} pocket substituents on the same acylguanidine scaffold also showed good agreement with experiment and the results remained stable with repeated simulations and increased simulation time. It proved more difficult to use FEP calculations to study the scaffold modification from increasing 5 to 6 and 7 membered-rings. Although prediction and experiment were in agreement for short 2 ns simulations, as the simulation time increased the results diverged. This was improved by the use of a newly developed ``Core Hopping FEP+'' approach, which also showed improved stability in repeat calculations. The origins of these differences along with the value of repeat and longer simulation times are discussed.

  abstract = {BACE-1 is the {$\beta$}-secretase responsible for the initial amyloidogenesis in Alzheimer's disease, catalyzing hydrolytic cleavage of substrate in a pH-sensitive manner. The catalytic mechanism of BACE-1 requires water-mediated proton transfer from aspartyl dyad to the substrate, as well as structural flexibility in the flap region. Thus, the coupling of protonation and conformational equilibria is essential to a full in silico characterization of BACE-1. In this work, we perform constant pH replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations on both apo BACE-1 and five BACE-1-inhibitor complexes to examine the effect of pH on dynamics and inhibitor binding properties of BACE-1. In our simulations, we find that solution pH controls the conformational flexibility of apo BACE-1, whereas bound inhibitors largely limit the motions of the holo enzyme at all levels of pH. The microscopic pKa values of titratable residues in BACE-1 including its aspartyl dyad are computed and compared between apo and inhibitor-bound states. Changes in protonation between the apo and holo forms suggest a thermodynamic linkage between binding of inhibitors and protons localized at the dyad. Utilizing our recently developed computational protocol applying the binding polynomial formalism to the constant pH molecular dynamics (CpHMD) framework, we are able to obtain the pH-dependent binding free energy profiles for various BACE-1-inhibitor complexes. Our results highlight the importance of correctly addressing the binding-induced protonation changes in protein-ligand systems where binding accompanies a net proton transfer. This work comprises the first application of our CpHMD-based free energy computational method to protein-ligand complexes and illustrates the value of CpHMD as an all-purpose tool for obtaining pH-dependent dynamics and binding free energies of biological systems.},

  abstract = {The three-dimensional (3D) superimposition of molecules of one biological target reflecting their relative bioactive orientation is key for several ligand-based drug design studies (e.g., QSAR studies, pharmacophore modeling). However, with the lack of sufficient ligand-protein complex structures, an experimental alignment is difficult or often impossible to obtain. Several computational 3D alignment tools have been developed by academic or commercial groups to address this challenge. Here, we present a new approach, MARS (Multiple Alignments by ROCS-based Similarity), that is based on the pairwise alignment of all molecules within the data set using the tool ROCS (Rapid Overlay of Chemical Structures). Each pairwise alignment is scored, and the results are captured in a score matrix. The ideal superimposition of the compounds in the set is then identified by the analysis of the score matrix building stepwise a superimposition of all molecules. The algorithm exploits similarities among all molecules in the data set to compute an optimal 3D alignment. This alignment tool presented here can be used for several applications, including pharmacophore model generation, 3D QSAR modeling, 3D clustering, identification of structural outliers, and addition of compounds to an already existing alignment. Case studies are shown, validating the 3D alignments for six different data sets.},

We found good agreement with experimental results, with an RMS error of 2.82~kcal/mol over the whole set and 1.86~kcal/mol over all the molecules except several hydroxyl-rich compounds where we find evidence for a systematic error in the force field. We tested two different solvent models, TIP3P and TIP4P-Ew, and obtained very similar hydration free energies for these two models; the RMS difference was 0.64~kcal/mol. We found that preferred conformation of the carboxylic acids in water differs from that in vacuum. Surprisingly, this conformational change is not adequately sampled on simulation timescales, so we apply an umbrella sampling technique to include free energies associated with the conformational change. Overall, the results of this test reveal that the force field parameters for some groups of molecules (such as hydroxyl-rich compounds) still need to be improved, but for most compounds, accuracy was consistent with that seen in our previous tests.},

  abstract = {Free energy calculations based on molecular dynamics simulations show considerable promise for applications ranging from drug discovery to prediction of physical properties and structure-function studies. But these calculations are still difficult and tedious to analyze, and best practices for analysis are not well defined or propagated. Essentially, each group analyzing these calculations needs to decide how to conduct the analysis and, usually, develop its own analysis tools. Here, we review and recommend best practices for analysis yielding reliable free energies from molecular simulations. Additionally, we provide a Python tool, alchemical-analysis.py, freely available on GitHub as part of the pymbar package (located at http://github.com/choderalab/pymbar), that implements the analysis practices reviewed here for several reference simulation packages, which can be adapted to handle data from other packages. Both this review and the tool covers analysis of alchemical calculations generally, including free energy estimates via both thermodynamic integration and free energy perturbation-based estimators. Our Python tool also handles output from multiple types of free energy calculations, including expanded ensemble and Hamiltonian replica exchange, as well as standard fixed ensemble calculations. We also survey a range of statistical and graphical ways of assessing the quality of the data and free energy estimates, and provide prototypes of these in our tool. We hope this tool and discussion will serve as a foundation for more standardization of and agreement on best practices for analysis of free energy calculations.},

  abstract = {The hit-to-lead and lead optimization processes usually involve the design, synthesis, and profiling of thousands of analogs prior to clinical candidate nomination. A hit finding campaign may begin with a virtual screen that explores millions of compounds, if not more. However, this scale of computational profiling is not frequently performed in the hit-to-lead or lead optimization phases of drug discovery. This is likely due to the lack of appropriate computational tools to generate synthetically tractable lead-like compounds in silico, and a lack of computational methods to accurately profile compounds prospectively on a large scale. Recent advances in computational power and methods provide the ability to profile much larger libraries of ligands than previously possible. Herein, we report a new computational technique, referred to as ``PathFinder'', that uses retrosynthetic analysis followed by combinatorial synthesis to generate novel compounds in synthetically accessible chemical space. In this work, the integration of PathFinder-driven compound generation, cloud-based FEP simulations, and active learning are used to rapidly optimize R-groups, and generate new cores for inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2). Using this approach, we explored {$>$}300 000 ideas, performed {$>$}5000 FEP simulations, and identified {$>$}100 ligands with a predicted IC50 {$<$} 100 nM, including four unique cores. To our knowledge, this is the largest set of FEP calculations disclosed in the literature to date. The rapid turnaround time, and scale of chemical exploration, suggests that this is a useful approach to accelerate the discovery of novel chemical matter in drug discovery campaigns.},

This method relies on the linearization and decoupling of the equations governing the atomic coordinate resetting corresponding to each constraint in a molecule, and is thus iterative. In the present study, we consider an alternative method, M-SHAKE, which solves the coupled equations simultaneously by matrix inversion. The performances of the two methods are compared in simulations of the pure solvents water, dimethyl sulfoxide, and chloroform. It is concluded that M-SHAKE is significantly faster than SHAKE when either (1) the molecules contain few distance constraints (solvent), or (2) when a high level of accuracy is required in the application of the constraints. \textcopyright{} 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

Therefore, we benchmark the GROMACS performance on a diverse set of compute nodes and relate it to the costs of the nodes, which may include their lifetime costs for energy and cooling. In agreement with our earlier investigation using GROMACS 4.6 on hardware of 2014, the performance to price ratio of consumer GPU nodes is considerably higher than that of CPU nodes. However, with GROMACS 2018, the optimal CPU to GPU processing power balance has shifted even more toward the GPU. Hence, nodes optimized for GROMACS 2018 and later versions enable a significantly higher performance to price ratio than nodes optimized for older GROMACS versions. Moreover, the shift toward GPU processing allows to cheaply upgrade old nodes with recent GPUs, yielding essentially the same performance as comparable brand-new hardware. \textcopyright{} 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

These analogs of the prototypical Neq0570 are halogenated reversible covalent inhibitors of hCatL, which bear a halogen atom in the meta position of the P3 benzyl ring that can form a halogen bond with the Gly61 of the hCatL. To describe halogen bonding interaction in an inhibitor-hCatL complex, we applied an extra point (EP) of charge to represent the anisotropic distribution of charge on the iodine, bromine and chlorine atoms. Besides, we have used alchemical free energy calculations for evaluating the overall relative binding free energies of these inhibitors using a two-state binding model: noncovalent and covalent bond states. Our results show that free energy perturbation (FEP) can predict the hCatL binding affinities of halogenated reversible covalent inhibitors in close agreement with experiments.},

Although novel ligands have been identified using methods such as virtual screening, computationally driven lead optimization has been possible only in isolated cases because of challenges associated with predicting binding free energies for related compounds. Here, we provide a systematic characterization of the performance of free-energy perturbation (FEP) calculations to predict relative binding free energies of congeneric ligands binding to GPCR targets using a consistent protocol and no adjustable parameters. Using the FEP+ package, first we validated the protocol, which includes a full lipid bilayer and explicit solvent, by predicting the binding affinity for a total of 45 different ligands across four different GPCRs (adenosine A2AAR, {$\beta$}1 adrenergic, CXCR4 chemokine, and {$\delta$} opioid receptors). Comparison with experimental binding affinity measurements revealed a highly predictive ranking correlation (average spearman {$\rho$} = 0.55) and low root-mean-square error (0.80 kcal/mol). Next, we applied FEP+ in a prospective project, where we predicted the affinity of novel, potent adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR) antagonists. Four novel compounds were synthesized and tested in a radioligand displacement assay, yielding affinity values in the nanomolar range. The affinity of two out of the four novel ligands (plus three previously reported compounds) was correctly predicted (within 1 kcal/mol), including one compound with approximately a tenfold increase in affinity compared to the starting compound. Detailed analyses of the simulations underlying the predictions provided insights into the structural basis for the two cases where the affinity was overpredicted. Taken together, these results establish a protocol for systematically applying FEP+ to GPCRs and provide guidelines for identifying potent molecules in drug discovery lead optimization projects.},

This proposal is meaningful for a broad range of biophysical problems, in which localized sampling is required. Besides its superior capability and robustness in localized conformational sampling, this simulated scaling method can also naturally lead to efficient ``alchemical'' free energy predictions when dual-topology alchemical hybrid potential is applied; thereby simultaneously, both of the chemically and conformationally distinct portions of two end point chemical states can be efficiently sampled. As demonstrated in this work, the present method is also feasible for the quantum mechanical and quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical simulations.},

  abstract = {Accurate hydrogen placement in molecular modeling is crucial for studying the interactions and dynamics of biomolecular systems. The carboxyl functional group is a prototypical example of a functional group that requires protonation during structure preparation. To our knowledge, when in their neutral form, carboxylic acids are typically protonated in the syn conformation by default in classical molecular modeling packages, with no consideration of alternative conformations, though we are not aware of any careful examination of this topic. Here, we investigate the general belief that carboxylic acids should always be protonated in the syn conformation. We calculate and compare the relative energetic stabilities of syn and anti acetic acid using ab initio quantum mechanical calculations and atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. We focus on the carboxyl torsional potential and configurations of microhydrated acetic acid from molecular dynamics simulations, probing the effects of solvent, force field (GAFF vs GAFF2), and partial charge assignment of acetic acid. We show that while the syn conformation is the preferred state, the anti state may in some cases also be present under normal NPT conditions in solution.},

This method leads to an efficient characterization of the binding free-energy surface and an accurate calculation of the absolute protein\textendash ligand binding free energy. We illustrate our protocol in two systems, benzamidine/trypsin and SC-558/cyclooxygenase 2. In both cases, the X-ray conformation has been found as the lowest free-energy pose, and the computed protein\textendash ligand binding free energy in good agreement with experiments. Furthermore, funnel metadynamics unveils important information about the binding process, such as the presence of alternative binding modes and the role of waters.

To calculate the solvation free energy of a simple ion, it is essential to take into account the polarization of nearby solvent but also the electrostatic potential drop across the liquid\textendash gas boundary, however distant. The latter does not exist in a simulation model based on periodic boundary conditions because there is no physical boundary to the system. An important consequence is that the reference value of the electrostatic potential is not an ion in a vacuum. Also, in an infinite system, the electrostatic potential felt by a perturbing charge is conditionally convergent and dependent on the choice of computational conventions. Furthermore, with Ewald lattice summation and tinfoil conducting boundary conditions, the charges experience a spurious shift in the potential that depends on the details of the simulation system such as the volume fraction occupied by the solvent. All these issues can be handled with established computational protocols, as reviewed here and illustrated for several small ions and three solvated proteins.},

We extend our comparisons of the TCW and TREx methods to the 5 residue met-enkephalin peptide, in which we evaluate the Kullback-Leibler divergence metric to show that the rate of convergence between two independent trajectories is faster for TCW compared to TREx.

Here, we introduce lead optimization mapper, LOMAP, an automated algorithm to plan efficient relative free energy calculations between potential ligands within a substantial library of perhaps hundreds of compounds. In this approach, ligands are first grouped by structural similarity primarily based on the size of a (loosely defined) maximal common substructure, and then calculations are planned within and between sets of structurally related compounds. An emphasis is placed on ensuring that relative free energies can be obtained between any pair of compounds without combining the results of too many different relative free energy calculations (to avoid accumulation of error) and by providing some redundancy to allow for the possibility of error and consistency checking and provide some insight into when results can be expected to be unreliable. The algorithm is discussed in detail and a Python implementation, based on both Schr\"odinger's and OpenEye's APIs, has been made available freely under the BSD license.},

Here we explore the magnitude of this error in several different model binding calculations.

Since the error is a function of ligand strain, which is unpredictable in advance, we believe that ring breaking should be avoided when possible.},

Contemporary molecular simulation software such as AMBER, CHARMM, GROMACS, and SOMD include support for the method. Implementation details vary among those codes, but users expect reliability and reproducibility, i.e., for a given molecular model and set of force field parameters, comparable free energy differences should be obtained within statistical bounds regardless of the code used. Relative alchemical free energy (RAFE) simulation is increasingly used to support molecule discovery projects, yet the reproducibility of the methodology has been less well tested than its absolute counterpart. Here we present RAFE calculations of hydration free energies for a set of small organic molecules and demonstrate that free energies can be reproduced to within about 0.2 kcal/mol with the aforementioned codes. Absolute alchemical free energy simulations have been carried out as a reference. Achieving this level of reproducibility requires considerable attention to detail and package-specific simulation protocols, and no universally applicable protocol emerges. The benchmarks and protocols reported here should be useful for the community to validate new and future versions of software for free energy calculations.},

Instead, methods are considered of the form beta(A(1)-A(0))=-ln[{$<$}w(u)exp(-betau/2){$>$}(0)/{$<$}w(u)exp( betau/2){$>$}(1)], where A is the free energy, beta=1/kT is the reciprocal temperature, u=U-1-U-0 is the difference in configurational energy, w(u) is a weighting function, and the angle brackets indicate an ensemble average performed on the system indicated by the subscript. Choices are considered in which w(u)=1 and{$\frac{1}$}cosh[(u-C)/2]; the latter being Bennett's method where C is a parameter that can be selected arbitrarily, and may be used to optimize the precision of the calculation. We examine the methods in several applications: calculation of the pressure of a square-well fluid by perturbing the volume, the chemical potential of a high-density Lennard-Jones system, and the chemical potential of a model for water. We find that the approaches based on Bennett's method weighting are very effective at ensuring an accurate result (one in which the systematic error arising from inadequate sampling is less than the estimated confidence limits), and that even the selection w(u)=1 offers marked improvement over comparable methods. We suggest that Bennett's method is underappreciated, and the benefits it offers for improved precision and (especially) accuracy are substantial, and therefore it should be more widely used.

Computing power and theory have, however, long been insufficient to enable AFE calculations to be routinely applied in early stage drug discovery. One of the major difficulties in performing AFE calculations is the length of time required for calculations to converge to an ensemble average. CPU implementations of MD-based free energy algorithms can effectively only reach tens of nanoseconds per day for systems on the order of 50,000 atoms, even running on massively parallel supercomputers. Therefore, converged free energy calculations on large numbers of potential lead compounds are often untenable, preventing researchers from gaining crucial insight into molecular recognition, potential druggability and other crucial areas of interest. Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) can help address this. We present here a seamless GPU implementation, within the PMEMD module of the AMBER molecular dynamics package, of thermodynamic integration (TI) capable of reaching speeds of {$>$}140 ns/day for a 44,907-atom system, with accuracy equivalent to the existing CPU implementation in AMBER.

Enhanced sampling methods may be used in order to speed up sampling by, for example, using high temperatures, as in parallel tempering, or simulating with a biasing potential such as in the case of umbrella sampling. The equilibrium properties of the thermodynamic state of interest (e.g., lowest temperature or unbiased potential) can be computed using reweighting estimators such as the weighted histogram analysis method or the multistate Bennett acceptance ratio (MBAR). weighted histogram analysis method and MBAR produce unbiased estimates, the simulation samples from the global equilibria at their respective thermodynamic states\textemdash a requirement that can be prohibitively expensive for some simulations such as a large parallel tempering ensemble of an explicitly solvated biomolecule. Here, we introduce the transition-based reweighting analysis method (TRAM)\textemdash a class of estimators that exploit ideas from Markov modeling and only require the simulation data to be in local equilibrium within subsets of the configuration space. We formulate the expanded TRAM (xTRAM) estimator that is shown to be asymptotically unbiased and a generalization of MBAR. Using four exemplary systems of varying complexity, we demonstrate the improved convergence (ranging from a twofold improvement to several orders of magnitude) of xTRAM in comparison to a direct counting estimator and MBAR, with respect to the invested simulation effort. Lastly, we introduce a random-swapping simulation protocol that can be used with xTRAM, gaining orders-of-magnitude advantages over simulation protocols that require the constraint of sampling from a global equilibrium.},

  abstract = {The Drug Design Data Resource (D3R) consortium organises blinded challenges to address the latest advances in computational methods for ligand pose prediction, affinity ranking, and free energy calculations. Within the context of the second D3R Grand Challenge several blinded binding free energies predictions were made for two congeneric series of Farsenoid X Receptor (FXR) inhibitors with a semi-automated alchemical free energy calculation workflow featuring FESetup and SOMD software~tools. Reasonable performance was observed in retrospective analyses of literature datasets. Nevertheless, blinded predictions on the full D3R datasets were poor due to difficulties encountered with the ranking of compounds that vary in their net-charge. Performance increased for predictions that were restricted to subsets of compounds carrying the same net-charge. Disclosure of X-ray crystallography derived binding modes maintained or improved the correlation with experiment in a subsequent rounds of predictions. The best performing protocols on D3R set1 and set2 were comparable or superior to predictions made on the basis of analysis of literature structure activity relationships (SAR)s only, and comparable or slightly inferior, to the best submissions from other groups.},

  abstract = {A strategy in drug design is to consider enhancing the affinity of lead molecules with structural modifications that displace water molecules from a protein binding site. Because success of the approach is uncertain, clarification of the associated energetics was sought in cases where similar structural modifications yield qualitatively different outcomes. Specifically, free-energy perturbation calculations were carried out in the context of Monte Carlo statistical mechanics simulations to investigate ligand series that feature displacement of ordered water molecules in the binding sites of scytalone dehydratase, p38-{$\alpha$}MAP kinase, and EGFR kinase. The change in affinity for a ligand modification is found to correlate with the ease of displacement of the ordered water molecule. However, as in the EGFR example, the binding affinity may diminish if the free-energy increase due to the removal of the bound water molecule is not more than compensated by the additional interactions of the water-displacing moiety. For accurate computation of the effects of ligand modifications, a complete thermodynamic analysis is shown to be needed. It requires identification of the location of water molecules in the protein-ligand interface and evaluation of the free-energy changes associated with their removal and with the introduction of the ligand modification. Direct modification of the ligand in free-energy calculations is likely to trap the ordered molecule and provide misleading guidance for lead optimization.},

Here, we find that the presence of multiple metastable ligand orientations can cause convergence problems when distance restraints alone are used. We demonstrate that the use of orientational restraints can greatly accelerate the convergence of these calculations. However, even with this acceleration, we find that sufficient sampling requires substantially longer simulations than are used in many published protocols. To further accelerate convergence, we introduce a new method of configuration space decomposition by orientation which reduces required simulation lengths by at least a factor of 5 in the cases examined. Our method is easily parallelizable, well suited for cases where a ligand cocrystal structure is not available, and can utilize initial orientations generated by docking packages.},

Here we apply alchemical free energy calculations in explicit solvent to predict ligand binding in a model cavity in T4 lysozyme. Even in this simple site, there are challenges. We made systematic improvements, beginning with single poses from docking, then including multiple poses, additional protein conformational changes, and using an improved charge model. Computed absolute binding free energies had an RMS error of 1.9 kcal/mol relative to previously determined. experimental values. In blind prospective tests, the methods correctly discriminated between several true ligands and decoys in a set of putative binders identified by docking. In these prospective tests, the RMS error in predicted binding free energies relative to those subsequently determined experimentally was only 0.6 kcal/mol. X-ray crystal structures of the new ligands bound in the cavity corresponded closely to predictions from the free energy calculations, but sometimes differed from those predicted by docking. Finally, we examined the impact of holding the protein rigid, as in docking, with a view to learning how approximations made in docking affect accuracy and how they may be improved.

The power of structural biology is in translating knowledge of protein structures into insights about their forces, binding, and mechanisms. However, the complementary power of computer modeling is in showing ``the rest of the story'' (i.e., how motions and ensembles and alternative conformers and the entropies and forces that cannot be seen in single molecular structures also contribute to binding affinities). Upon binding to a protein, a ligand can bind in multiple orientations; the protein or ligand can be deformed by the binding event; waters, ions, or cofactors can have unexpected involvement; and conformational or solvation entropies can sometimes play large and otherwise unpredictable roles. Computer modeling is helping to elucidate these factors.},

Alchemical free energy calculations seek to change that by providing rigorous binding free energies from molecular simulations. Given adequate sampling and an accurate enough force field, these techniques yield accurate free energy estimates. Recent innovations in alchemical techniques have sparked a resurgence of interest in these calculations. Still, many obstacles stand in the way of their routine application in a drug discovery context, including the one we focus on here, sampling. Sampling of binding modes poses a particular challenge as binding modes are often separated by large energy barriers, leading to slow transitions. Binding modes are difficult to predict, and in some cases multiple binding modes may contribute to binding. In view of these hurdles, we present a framework for dealing carefully with uncertainty in binding mode or conformation in the context of free energy calculations. With careful sampling, free energy techniques show considerable promise for aiding drug discovery.},

In such a context, solubility optimization cannot be successfully pursued by indiscriminate increases in polarity, which would likely reduce permeability and potency. Moreover, increasing polarity may not even improve solubility itself in many cases, if it stabilizes the solid-state form. Here we present a novel physics-based approach to predict the solubility of small molecules, that takes into account three-dimensional solid-state characteristics in addition to polarity. The calculated solubilities are in good agreement with experimental solubilities taken both from the literature as well as from several active pharmaceutical discovery projects. This computational approach enables strategies to optimize solubility by disrupting the three-dimensional solid-state packing of novel chemical matter, illustrated here for an active medicinal chemistry campaign.},

A subset of the selected guest molecules were those included in the SAMPL4 prediction challenge. Using expanded ensemble simulations in the dimension of coupling host\textendash guest intermolecular interactions, we are able to show that our estimates in most cases can be demonstrated to fully converge and that the errors in our estimates are due almost entirely to the assigned force field parameters and the choice of environmental conditions used to model experiment. We confirm the convergence through the use of alternative simulation methodologies and thermodynamic pathways, analyzing sampled conformations, and directly observing changes of the free energy with respect to simulation time. Our results demonstrate the benefits of enhanced sampling of multiple local free energy minima made possible by the use of expanded ensemble molecular dynamics and may indicate the presence of significant problems with current transferable force fields for organic molecules when used for calculating binding affinities, especially in non-protein chemistries.},

  abstract = {Prospective validation of methods for computing binding affinities can help assess their predictive power and thus set reasonable expectations for their performance in drug design applications. Supramolecular host\textendash guest systems are excellent model systems for testing such affinity prediction methods, because their small size and limited conformational flexibility, relative to proteins, allows higher throughput and better numerical convergence. The SAMPL4 prediction challenge therefore included a series of host\textendash guest systems, based on two hosts, cucurbit[7]uril and octa-acid. Binding affinities in aqueous solution were measured experimentally for a total of 23 guest molecules. Participants submitted 35 sets of computational predictions for these host\textendash guest systems, based on methods ranging from simple docking, to extensive free energy simulations, to quantum mechanical calculations. Over half of the predictions provided better correlations with experiment than two simple null models, but most methods underperformed the null models in terms of root mean squared error and linear regression slope. Interestingly, the overall performance across all SAMPL4 submissions was similar to that for the prior SAMPL3 host\textendash guest challenge, although the experimentalists took steps to simplify the current challenge. While some methods performed fairly consistently across both hosts, no single approach emerged as consistent top performer, and the nonsystematic nature of the various submissions made it impossible to draw definitive conclusions regarding the best choices of energy models or sampling algorithms. Salt effects emerged as an issue in the calculation of absolute binding affinities of cucurbit[7]uril-guest systems, but were not expected to affect the relative affinities significantly. Useful directions for future rounds of the challenge might involve encouraging participants to carry out some calculations that replicate each others' studies, and to systematically explore parameter options.},

This approach splits the potential energy function into a sum of pairs of basis functions, which depend on coordinates, and `alchemical' switches, which depend only on the coupling variable. The power of this approach is that, first, the calculation of the coupling parameter dependent terms is removed from inner loop force calculation routines, second, the flexibility in specifying basis functions and alchemical switches allows users to choose transformation pathways that maximize statistical efficiency, and third, it is possible to predict entirely in postprocessing, without any additional energy evaluations, the thermodynamic properties along any alchemical path with moderate overlap from an initial simulation that uses the same basis functions. This allows construction of optimized, minimum variance alchemical switches from a single simulation with fixed basis functions and trial alchemical switching functions. We describe how to construct these linear basis potentials for real molecular systems of different sizes and shapes, considering particularly the problems of eliminating singularities and minimizing variance of particle removal in dense fluids. The statistical error in free energy calculations using the optimized basis functions is lower than standard soft core models, and approach the minimum variance possible over all pair potentials. We recommend an optimized set of basis functions and alchemical switches for standard molecular free energy calculations.},

We also explore the order in which nonbonded forces are coupled to the environment in alchemical transformations. We test two sets of Lennard-Jones basis functions, a Weeks\textendash Chandler\textendash Andersen (WCA) and a 12\textendash 6 decomposition of the repulsive and attractive forces turned on in sequence along with changes in charge, to determine a statistically optimized order in which forces should be coupled. The WCA decomposition has lower statistical uncertainty as coupling the attractive r\textendash 6 basis function contributes non-negligible statistical error. In all cases, the charge should be coupled only after the repulsive core is fully coupled, and the WCA attractive portion can be coupled at any stage without significantly changing the efficiency. The statistical uncertainty of two of the basis function approaches with charged particles is nearly identical to the soft core approach for decoupling electrostatics, though the correlation times for sampling are often longer for a soft core electrostatics approach than the basis function approach. The basis function approach for introducing or removing molecules or functional groups thus represents a useful alternative to the soft core approach with a number of clear computational advantages.},

While a former paper in this series concentrated on the first of these, this second paper focuses on comparison, i.e. how do we calculate differences in methods in an accurate and statistically valid manner. Described within are classical statistical approaches for comparing widely used metrics such as enrichment, area under the curve and Pearson's product-moment coefficient, as well as generic measures. These are considered of over single and multiple sets of data and for two or more methods that evince either independent or correlated behavior. General issues concerning significance testing and confidence limits from a Bayesian perspective are discussed, along with size-of-effect aspects of evaluation.},

  abstract = {Alchemically derived free energies are artifacted when the perturbed moiety has a nonzero net charge. The source of the artifacts lies in the effective treatment of the electrostatic interactions within and between the perturbed atoms and remaining (partial) charges in the simulated system. To treat the electrostatic interactions effectively, lattice-summation (LS) methods or cutoff schemes in combination with a reaction-field contribution are usually employed. Both methods render the charging component of the calculated free energies sensitive to essential parameters of the system like the cutoff radius or the box side lengths. Here, we discuss the results of three previously published studies of ligand binding. These studies presented estimates of binding free energies that were artifacted due to the charged nature of the ligands. We show that the size of the artifacts can be efficiently calculated and raw simulation data can be corrected. We compare the corrected results with experimental estimates and nonartifacted estimates from path-sampling methods. Although the employed correction scheme involves computationally demanding continuum-electrostatics calculations, we show that the correction estimate can be deduced from a small sample of configurations rather than from the entire ensemble. This observation makes the calculations of correction terms feasible for complex biological systems. To show the general applicability of the proposed procedure, we also present results where the correction scheme was used to correct independent free energies obtained from simulations employing a cutoff scheme or LS electrostatics. In this work, we give practical guidelines on how to apply the appropriate corrections easily.},

Since the goal of this study is to lay out the framework and validate the concept, it focuses on Asp and Glu residues where the protein pKa values and structures are assumed to be more reliable. The new and improved implementation is evaluated and discussed; it is found to agree better with experiment than the previous implementation (in parentheses): rmsd = 0.79 (0.91) for Asp and Glu, 0.75 (0.97) for Tyr, 0.65 (0.72) for Lys, and 1.00 (1.37) for His residues.

  abstract = {Formation of protein-ligand complexes causes various changes in both the receptor and the ligand. This review focuses on changes in pK and protonation states of ionizable groups that accompany protein-ligand binding. Physical origins of these effects are outlined, followed by a brief overview of the computational methods to predict them and the associated corrections to receptor-ligand binding affinities. Statistical prevalence, magnitude, and spatial distribution of the pK and protonation state changes in protein-ligand binding are discussed in detail, based on both experimental and theoretical studies. While there is no doubt that these changes occur, they do not occur all the time; the estimated prevalence varies, both between individual complexes and by method. The changes occur not only in the immediate vicinity of the interface, but sometimes far away. When receptor-ligand binding is associated with protonation state change at particular pH, the binding becomes pH dependent: we review the interplay between sub-cellular characteristic pH and optimum pH of receptor-ligand binding. It is pointed out that there is a tendency for protonation state changes upon binding to be minimal at physiologically relevant pH for each complex (no net proton uptake/release), suggesting that native receptor-ligand interactions evolved to reduce the energy cost associated with ionization changes. As a result, previously reported statistical prevalence of these changes \textendash{} typically computed at the same pH for all complexes \textendash{} may be higher than what may be expected at optimum pH specific to each complex. We also discuss whether proper account of protonation state changes appears to improve practical docking and scoring outcomes relevant to structure-based drug design. An overview of some of the existing challenges in the field is provided in conclusion.},

As more protein structures are determined experimentally using X-ray crystallography or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, molecular docking is increasingly used as a tool in drug discovery. Docking against homology-modeled targets also becomes possible for proteins whose structures are not known. With the docking strategies, the druggability of the compounds and their specificity against a particular target can be calculated for further lead optimization processes. Molecular docking programs perform a search algorithm in which the conformation of the ligand is evaluated recursively until the convergence to the minimum energy is reached. Finally, an affinity scoring function, {$\Delta$}G [U total in kcal/mol], is employed to rank the candidate poses as the sum of the electrostatic and van der Waals energies. The driving forces for these specific interactions in biological systems aim toward complementarities between the shape and electrostatics of the binding site surfaces and the ligand or substrate.},

We use this benchmark set to compare the statistical efficiency, reliability, and quality of uncertainty estimates for a number of published free energy methods, including thermodynamic integration, free energy perturbation, the Bennett acceptance ratio (BAR) and its multistate equivalent MBAR. We identify MBAR as the consistently best performing method, though other methods are frequently comparable in reliability and accuracy in many cases. We demonstrate that assumptions of Gaussian distributed errors in free energies are usually valid for most methods studied. We demonstrate that bootstrap error estimation is a robust and useful technique for estimating statistical variance for all free energy methods studied. This benchmark set is provided in a number of different file formats with the hope of becoming a useful and general tool for method comparisons.},

  abstract = {Alchemical free energy simulations are amongst the most accurate techniques for the computation of the free energy changes associated with noncovalent protein\textendash ligand interactions. A procedure is presented to estimate the relative binding free energies of several ligands to the same protein target where multiple, low-energy configurational substates might coexist, as opposed to one unique structure. The contributions of all individual substates were estimated, explicitly, with the free energy perturbation method, and combined in a rigorous fashion to compute the overall relative binding free energies and dissociation constants. It is shown that, unless the most stable bound forms are known a priori, inaccurate results may be obtained if the contributions of multiple substates are ignored. The method was applied to study the complex formed between human catechol-O-methyltransferase and BIA 9-1067, a newly developed tight-binding inhibitor that is currently under clinical evaluation for the therapy of Parkinson's disease. Our results reveal an exceptionally high-binding affinity (Kd in subpicomolar range) and provide insightful clues on the interactions and mechanism of inhibition. The inhibitor is, itself, a slowly reacting substrate of the target enzyme and is released from the complex in the form of O-methylated product. By comparing the experimental catalytic rate (kcat) and the estimated dissociation rate (koff) constants of the enzyme-inhibitor complex, one can conclude that the observed inhibition potency (Ki) is primarily dependent on the catalytic rate constant of the inhibitor's O-methylation, rather than the rate constant of dissociation of the complex. \textcopyright{} 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Molecules with small substituents do not enter the pocket, a critical leucine (Leu770) is closed and water molecules are present. Large substituents enter the pocket, opening the Leu770 conformation and displacing the waters. We also report an X-ray structure revealing a new conformation of the PDE2 active site domain. The relative binding affinities of these compounds were studied with free energy perturbation (FEP) methods and it represents an attractive real-world test case. In general, the calculations could predict the energy of small-to-small, or large-to-large molecule perturbations. However, accurately capturing the transition from small-to-large proved challenging. Only when using alternative protein conformations did results improve. The new X-ray structure, along with a modelled dimer, conferred stability to the catalytic domain during the FEP molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, increasing the convergence and thereby improving the prediction of {$\Delta\Delta$}G of binding for some small-to-large transitions. In summary, we found the most significant improvement in results when using different protein structures, and this data set is useful for future free energy validation studies.},

We performed FEP calculations with two different software methods: Schr\"odinger-Desmond FEP+ and GROMACS implementations. There was qualitative agreement in the results from the two methods, and quantitatively the error for one data set was identical, 1.43 kcal/mol, but FEP+ performed better in the second, with errors of 1.17 versus 1.90 kcal/mol. The results have far-reaching implications, suggesting well-implemented FEP calculations can have a major impact on computational drug design.},

In contrast to previously suggested EDS approaches, our reference-state Hamiltonian preserves local energy minima of the combined end-states. Moreover, we propose an intuitive, robust and efficient parameter optimization scheme to tune EDS Hamiltonian parameters. We demonstrate the proposed method with established and novel test systems and conclude that our approach allows for the automated calculation of multiple free-energy differences from a single simulation.

  abstract = {The origins of binding affinity and COX-2/COX-1 selectivity for analogues of celecoxib have been explored using an approach that combines docking with Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. These inhibitors are COX-2-selective nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that are of current interest because the gastrointestinal irritation they cause is reduced compared to that caused by traditional NSAIDs. We report a novel docking method, based on a combined Tabu and Monte Carlo protocol, that determines starting conformations for MC simulations. Using the docking-predicted starting conformations, relative changes in binding free energies were computed for methyl, ethyl, hydroxymethyl, hydroxyl, thiomethyl, methoxy, trifluoromethyl, chloro, fluoro, and unsubstituted derivatives with the MC free energy perturbation (FEP) method. The computed free energies are in good accord with IC50 values, and the structural information from the simulations can be used to explain the experimentally observed binding trends. In addition, the docking and FEP results have provided clarification of the binding conformation of the phenylsulfonamide moiety and the origin of COX-2/COX-1 selectivity. Namely, the COX-2 Val \$\textbackslash rightarrow\$ COX-1 Ile subtitution is accompanied by an unfavorable conformational shift of the phenylsulfonamide ring.},

Yet, the reliability of these calculations can often be improved significantly if a number of precepts, or good practices, are followed. Although the theory upon which these good practices rely has largely been known for many years, it is often overlooked or simply ignored. In other cases, the theoretical developments are too recent for their potential to be fully grasped and merged into popular platforms for the computation of free-energy differences. In this contribution, the current best practices for carrying out free-energy calculations using free energy perturbation and nonequilibrium work methods are discussed, demonstrating that at little to no additional cost, free-energy estimates could be markedly improved and bounded by meaningful error estimates. Monitoring the probability distributions that underlie the transformation between the states of interest, performing the calculation bidirectionally, stratifying the reaction pathway, and choosing the most appropriate paradigms and algorithms for transforming between states offer significant gains in both accuracy and precision.},

The method is based on the assumption that any observed work distribution is given by a mixture of Gaussian distributions, whose normal components are identical in either direction of the nonequilibrium process, with weights regulated by the Crooks theorem. Using the prototypical example for the driven unfolding/folding of deca-alanine, we show that the predicted behavior of the forward and reverse work distributions, assuming a combination of only two Gaussian components with Crooks derived weights, explains surprisingly well the striking asymmetry in the observed distributions at fast pulling speeds. The proposed methodology opens the way for a perfectly parallel implementation of Jarzynski-based free energy calculations in complex systems.},

  abstract = {Accurately predicting the binding affinities of small organic molecules to biological macromolecules can greatly accelerate drug discovery by reducing the number of compounds that must be synthesized to realize desired potency and selectivity goals. Unfortunately, the process of assessing the accuracy of current computational approaches to affinity prediction against binding data to biological macromolecules is frustrated by several challenges, such as slow conformational dynamics, multiple titratable groups, and the lack of high-quality blinded datasets. Over the last several SAMPL blind challenge exercises, host\textendash guest systems have emerged as a practical and effective way to circumvent these challenges in assessing the predictive performance of current-generation quantitative modeling tools, while still providing systems capable of possessing tight binding affinities. Here, we present an overview of the SAMPL6 host\textendash guest binding affinity prediction challenge, which featured three supramolecular hosts: octa-acid (OA), the closely related tetra-endo-methyl-octa-acid (TEMOA), and cucurbit[8]uril (CB8), along with 21 small organic guest molecules. A total of 119 entries were received from ten participating groups employing a variety of methods that spanned from electronic structure and movable type calculations in implicit solvent to alchemical and potential of mean force strategies using empirical force fields with explicit solvent models. While empirical models tended to obtain better performance than first-principle methods, it was not possible to identify a single approach that consistently provided superior results across all host\textendash guest systems and statistical metrics. Moreover, the accuracy of the methodologies generally displayed a substantial dependence on the system considered, emphasizing the need for host diversity in blind evaluations. Several entries exploited previous experimental measurements of similar host\textendash guest systems in an effort to improve their physical-based predictions via some manner of rudimentary machine learning; while this strategy succeeded in reducing systematic errors, it did not correspond to an improvement in statistical correlation. Comparison to previous rounds of the host\textendash guest binding free energy challenge highlights an overall improvement in the correlation obtained by the affinity predictions for OA and TEMOA systems, but a surprising lack of improvement regarding root mean square error over the past several challenge rounds. The data suggests that further refinement of force field parameters, as well as improved treatment of chemical effects (e.g., buffer salt conditions, protonation states), may be required to further enhance predictive accuracy.},

  abstract = {The calculation of a protein-ligand binding free energy based on molecular dynamics (MD) simulations generally relies on a thermodynamic cycle in which the ligand is alchemically inserted into the system, both in the solvated protein and free in solution. The corresponding ligand-insertion free energies are typically calculated in nanoscale computational boxes simulated under periodic boundary conditions and considering electrostatic interactions defined by a periodic lattice-sum. This is distinct from the ideal bulk situation of a system of macroscopic size simulated under non-periodic boundary conditions with Coulombic electrostatic interactions. This discrepancy results in finite-size effects, which affect primarily the charging component of the insertion free energy, are dependent on the box size, and can be large when the ligand bears a net charge, especially if the protein is charged as well. This article investigates finite-size effects on calculated charging free energies using as a test case the binding of the ligand 2-amino-5-methylthiazole (net charge +1 e) to a mutant form of yeast cytochrome c peroxidase in water. Considering different charge isoforms of the protein (net charges -5, 0, +3, or +9 e), either in the absence or the presence of neutralizing counter-ions, and sizes of the cubic computational box (edges ranging from 7.42 to 11.02 nm), the potentially large magnitude of finite-size effects on the raw charging free energies (up to 17.1 kJ\,mol(-1)) is demonstrated. Two correction schemes are then proposed to eliminate these effects, a numerical and an analytical one. Both schemes are based on a continuum-electrostatics analysis and require performing Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) calculations on the protein-ligand system. While the numerical scheme requires PB calculations under both non-periodic and periodic boundary conditions, the latter at the box size considered in the MD simulations, the analytical scheme only requires three non-periodic PB calculations for a given system, its dependence on the box size being analytical. The latter scheme also provides insight into the physical origin of the finite-size effects. These two schemes also encompass a correction for discrete solvent effects that persists even in the limit of infinite box sizes. Application of either scheme essentially eliminates the size dependence of the corrected charging free energies (maximal deviation of 1.5 kJ\,mol(-1)). Because it is simple to apply, the analytical correction scheme offers a general solution to the problem of finite-size effects in free-energy calculations involving charged solutes, as encountered in calculations concerning, e.g., protein-ligand binding, biomolecular association, residue mutation, pKa and redox potential estimation, substrate transformation, solvation, and solvent-solvent partitioning.},

In this work, we report theoretical and methodological developments to the grand canonical Monte Carlo simulation technique. Central to our results is a rigorous equation that can be used to calculate efficiently the binding free energies of water networks of arbitrary size and complexity. Using a single set of simulations, our methods can locate waters, estimate their binding affinities, capture the cooperativity of the water network, and evaluate the hydration free energy of entire protein binding sites. Our techniques have been applied to multiple test systems and compare favorably to thermodynamic integration simulations and experimental data. The implications of these methods in drug design are discussed.},

Surpassing this accuracy limit would significantly reduce the number of compounds that must be synthesized to achieve desired potencies and selectivities in drug design campaigns. However, MM force fields pose a challenge to achieving higher accuracy due to their inability to capture the intricate atomic interactions of the physical systems they model. A major limitation is the accuracy with which ligand intramolecular energetics\textemdash especially torsions\textemdash can be modeled, as poor modeling of torsional profiles and coupling with other valence degrees of freedom can have a significant impact on binding free energies. Here, we demonstrate how a new generation of hybrid machine learning / molecular mechanics (ML/MM) potentials can deliver significant accuracy improvements in modeling protein-ligand binding affinities. Using a nonequilibrium perturbation approach, we can correct a standard, GPU-accelerated MM alchemical free energy calculation in a simple post-processing step to efficiently recover ML/MM free energies and deliver a significant accuracy improvement with small additional computational effort. To demonstrate the utility of ML/MM free energy calculations, we apply this approach to a benchmark system for predicting kinase:inhibitor binding affinities\textemdash a congeneric ligand series for non-receptor tyrosine kinase TYK2 (Tyk2)\textemdash wherein state-of-the-art MM free energy calculations (with OPLS2.1) achieve inaccuracies of 0.93{$\pm$}0.12 kcal mol\textsuperscript{-1} in predicting absolute binding free energies.

The derivative of the Hamiltonian with respect to lambda, {$\langle\partial$}H/{$\partial\lambda\rangle$}, is determined at multiple {$\lambda$}-points. Because a numerical integration step is necessary, high curvature regions require simulations at densely spaced {$\lambda$}-points. Here, the principle of extended TI is introduced, where {$\langle\partial$}H/{$\partial\lambda\rangle$} values are predicted at nonsimulated {$\lambda$}-points. On the basis of three model systems, it is shown that extended TI requires significantly fewer {$\lambda$}-points than regular TI to obtain similar accuracy.},

  abstract = {Identification of chemical compounds with specific biological activities is an important step in both chemical biology and drug discovery. When the structure of the intended target is available, one approach is to use molecular docking programs to assess the chemical complementarity of small molecules with the target; such calculations provide a qualitative measure of affinity that can be used in virtual screening (VS) to rank order a list of compounds according to their potential to be active. rDock is a molecular docking program developed at Vernalis for high-throughput VS (HTVS) applications. Evolved from RiboDock, the program can be used against proteins and nucleic acids, is designed to be computationally very efficient and allows the user to incorporate additional constraints and information as a bias to guide docking. This article provides an overview of the program structure and features and compares rDock to two reference programs, AutoDock Vina (open source) and Schr\"odinger's Glide (commercial). In terms of computational speed for VS, rDock is faster than Vina and comparable to Glide. For binding mode prediction, rDock and Vina are superior to Glide. The VS performance of rDock is significantly better than Vina, but inferior to Glide for most systems unless pharmacophore constraints are used; in that case rDock and Glide are of equal performance. The program is released under the Lesser General Public License and is freely available for download, together with the manuals, example files and the complete test sets, at http://rdock.sourceforge.net/},

  abstract = {Small molecule distribution coefficients between immiscible nonaqueuous and aqueous phases\textemdash such as cyclohexane and water\textemdash measure the degree to which small molecules prefer one phase over another at a given pH. As distribution coefficients capture both thermodynamic effects (the free energy of transfer between phases) and chemical effects (protonation state and tautomer effects in aqueous solution), they provide an exacting test of the thermodynamic and chemical accuracy of physical models without the long correlation times inherent to the prediction of more complex properties of relevance to drug discovery, such as protein-ligand binding affinities. For the SAMPL5 challenge, we carried out a blind prediction exercise in which participants were tasked with the prediction of distribution coefficients to assess its potential as a new route for the evaluation and systematic improvement of predictive physical models. These measurements are typically performed for octanol-water, but we opted to utilize cyclohexane for the nonpolar phase. Cyclohexane was suggested to avoid issues with the high water content and persistent heterogeneous structure of water-saturated octanol phases, since it has greatly reduced water content and a homogeneous liquid structure. Using a modified shake-flask LC-MS/MS protocol, we collected cyclohexane/water distribution coefficients for a set of 53 druglike compounds at pH 7.4. These measurements were used as the basis for the SAMPL5 Distribution Coefficient Challenge, where 18 research groups predicted these measurements before the experimental values reported here were released. In this work, we describe the experimental protocol we utilized for measurement of cyclohexane-water distribution coefficients, report the measured data, propose a new bootstrap-based data analysis procedure to incorporate multiple sources of experimental error, and provide insights to help guide future iterations of this valuable exercise in predictive modeling.},

  abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) allows the study of biological and chemical systems at the atomistic level on timescales from femtoseconds to milliseconds. It complements experiment while also offering a way to follow processes difficult to discern with experimental techniques. Numerous software packages exist for conducting MD simulations of which one of the widest used is termed Amber. Here, we outline the most recent developments, since version 9 was released in April 2006, of the Amber and AmberTools MD software packages, referred to here as simply the Amber package. The latest release represents six years of continued development, since version 9, by multiple research groups and the culmination of over 33 years of work beginning with the first version in 1979. The latest release of the Amber package, version 12 released in April 2012, includes a substantial number of important developments in both the scientific and computer science arenas. We present here a condensed vision of what Amber currently supports and where things are likely to head over the coming years. Figure 1 shows the performance in ns/day of the Amber package version 12 on a single-core AMD FX-8120 8-Core 3.6GHz CPU, the Cray XT5 system, and a single GPU GTX680. \textcopyright{} 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.

This document is intended both as a tutorial and as an adaptable protocol for computing free energies of binding using free energy perturbations in NAMD. We present the Streamlined Alchemical Free Energy Perturbation (SAFEP) framework. SAFEP shifts the computational frame of reference from the ligand to the binding site itself. This both simplifies the thermodynamic cycle and makes the approach more broadly applicable to superficial sites and other less common geometries. As a practical example, we give instructions for calculating the absolute binding free energy of phenol to lysozyme. We assume familiarity with standard procedures for setting up, running, and analyzing molecular dynamics simulations using NAMD and VMD. While simulation times will vary, the human tasks should take no more than 3 to 4 hours for a reader without previous training in free energy calculations or ex- perience with the VMD Colvars Dashboard. Sample data are provided for all key calculations both for comparison and readers' convenience.},

  abstract = {Flexible ligands often have multiple binding modes or bound conformations that differ by rotation of a portion of the molecule around internal rotatable bonds. Knowledge of these binding modes is important for understanding the interactions stabilizing the ligand in the binding pocket, and other studies indicate it is important for calculating accurate binding affinities. In this work, we use a hybrid molecular dynamics (MD)/nonequilibrium candidate Monte Carlo (NCMC) method to sample the different binding modes of several flexible ligands and also to estimate the population distribution of the modes. The NCMC move proposal is divided into three parts. The flexible part of the ligand is alchemically turned off by decreasing the electrostatics and steric interactions gradually, followed by rotating the rotatable bond by a random angle and then slowly turning the ligand back on to its fully interacting state. The alchemical steps prior to and after the move proposal help the surrounding protein and water atoms in the binding pocket relax around the proposed ligand conformation and increase move acceptance rates. The protein\textendash ligand system is propagated using classical MD in between the NCMC proposals. Using this MD/NCMC method, we were able to correctly reproduce the different binding modes of inhibitors binding to two kinase targets\textemdash c-Jun N-terminal kinase-1 and cyclin-dependent kinase 2\textemdash at a much lower computational cost compared to conventional MD and umbrella sampling. This method is available as a part of the BLUES software package.},

Compared to pure machine-learning approaches, FEP/ML yields more precise estimates of free energies of hydration and requires a fraction of the training set size to outperform standalone FEP calculations. The ML-derived correction terms are further shown to be transferable to a range of related FEP simulation protocols. The approach may be used to inexpensively improve the accuracy of FEP calculations and to flag molecules which will benefit the most from bespoke force field parametrization efforts.},

A small-molecule inhibitor of Abl (STI-571) is effective in the treatment of CML. We report the crystal structure of the catalytic domain of Abl, complexed to a variant of STI-571. Critical to the binding of STI-571 is the adoption by the kinase of an inactive conformation, in which a centrally located ``activation loop'' is not phosphorylated. The conformation of this loop is distinct from that in active protein kinases, as well as in the inactive form of the closely related Src kinases. These results suggest that compounds that exploit the distinctive inactivation mechanisms of individual protein kinases can achieve both high affinity and high specificity.},

  abstract = {This report presents the application of polynomial regression for estimating free energy differences using thermodynamic integration data, i.e., slope of free energy with respect to the switching variable {$\lambda$}. We employ linear regression to construct a polynomial that optimally fits the thermodynamic integration data, and thus reduces the bias and uncertainty of the resulting free energy estimate. Two test systems with analytical solutions were used to verify the accuracy and precision of the approach. Our results suggest that use of regression with high degree of polynomials provides the most accurate free energy difference estimates, but often with slightly larger uncertainty, compared to commonly used quadrature techniques. High degree polynomials possess the flexibility to closely fit the thermodynamic integration data but are often sensitive to small changes in the data points. Thus, we also used Chebyshev nodes to guide in the selection of nonequidistant {$\lambda$} values for use in thermodynamic integration. We conclude that polynomial regression with nonequidistant {$\lambda$} values delivers the most accurate and precise free energy estimates for thermodynamic integration data for the systems considered here.

  abstract = {Replica-exchange enveloping distribution sampling (RE-EDS) allows the efficient estimation of free-energy differences between multiple end-states from a single molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. In EDS, a reference state is sampled, which can be tuned by two types of parameters, i.e., smoothness parameters(s) and energy offsets, such that all end-states are sufficiently sampled. However, the choice of these parameters is not trivial. Replica exchange (RE) or parallel tempering is a widely applied technique to enhance sampling. By combining EDS with the RE technique, the parameter choice problem could be simplified and the challenge shifted toward an optimal distribution of the replicas in the smoothness-parameter space. The choice of a certain replica distribution can alter the sampling efficiency significantly. In this work, global round-trip time optimization (GRTO) algorithms are tested for the use in RE-EDS simulations. In addition, a local round-trip time optimization (LRTO) algorithm is proposed for systems with slowly adapting environments, where a reliable estimate for the round-trip time is challenging to obtain. The optimization algorithms were applied to RE-EDS simulations of a system of nine small-molecule inhibitors of phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT). The energy offsets were determined using our recently proposed parallel energy-offset (PEOE) estimation scheme. While the multistate GRTO algorithm yielded the best replica distribution for the ligands in water, the multistate LRTO algorithm was found to be the method of choice for the ligands in complex with PNMT. With this, the 36 alchemical free-energy differences between the nine ligands were calculated successfully from a single RE-EDS simulation 10 ns in length. Thus, RE-EDS presents an efficient method for the estimation of relative binding free energies.},

The number of different ligand chemical groups that are automatically recognized has been increased to 18, and the general implementation has been changed so that new functional groups can be added easily by the user, aided by a new and more general protonation scheme. Except for a few cases, the new algorithms in PROPKA3.1 are found to yield results similar to or better than those obtained with PROPKA2.0 (Bas et al.

Using their GPU free energy code (FEP+) and the OPLS2.1 force field combined with the REST2 enhanced sampling approach, these authors obtained an overall MUE of 0.9 kcal/mol and an overall RMSD of 1.14 kcal/mol. In our study using GPU-TI from AMBER with the AMBER14SB/GAFF1.8 force field but without enhanced sampling, we obtained an overall MUE of 1.17 kcal/mol and an overall RMSD of 1.50 kcal/mol for the 330 perturbations contained in this data set. A more detailed analysis of our results suggested that the observed differences between the two studies arise from differences in sampling protocols along with differences in the force fields employed. Future work should address the problem of establishing benchmark quality results with robust statistical error bars obtained through multiple independent runs and enhanced sampling, which is possible with the GPU-accelerated features in AMBER.},

Thermodynamic integration (TI) calculations can suffer from instabilities during the creation or annihilation of particles. This ``singularity'' problem can be addressed with ``soft-core'' potential functions which keep pairwise interaction energies finite for all configurations and provide smooth free energy curves. ``One-step'' transformations, in which electrostatic and van der Waals forces are simultaneously modified, can be simpler and less expensive than ``two-step'' transformations in which these properties are changed in separate calculations. Here, we study solvation free energies for molecules of different hydrophobicity using both models.

The recent development and validation of advanced free energy calculation methods represents a major step toward this goal. Accurately predicting the relative binding free energy changes of modifications to ligands is especially valuable in the field of fragment-based drug design, since fragment screens tend to deliver initial hits of low binding affinity that require multiple rounds of synthesis to gain the requisite potency for a project. In this study, we show that a free energy perturbation protocol, FEP+, which was previously validated on drug-like lead compounds, is suitable for the calculation of relative binding strengths of fragment-sized compounds as well. We study several pharmaceutically relevant targets with a total of more than 90 fragments and find that the FEP+ methodology, which uses explicit solvent molecular dynamics and physics-based scoring with no parameters adjusted, can accurately predict relative fragment binding affinities. The calculations afford R2-values on average greater than 0.5 compared to experimental data and RMS errors of ca. 1.1 kcal/mol overall, demonstrating significant improvements over the docking and MM-GBSA methods tested in this work and indicating that FEP+ has the requisite predictive power to impact fragment-based affinity optimization projects.},

For two different situations in which independent observations are simulated from multiple distributions, we show that this likelihood approach achieves the lowest asymptotic variance possible by using estimating equations. In the first situation, the normalizing constants of the design distributions are estimated, and Meng and Wong's bridge sampling estimating equation is considered. In the second situation, the values of the normalizing constants are known, thereby imposing linear constraints on the baseline measure. Estimating equations including Hesterberg's stratified importance sampling estimator, Veach and Guibas's multiple importance sampling estimator, and Owen and Zhou's method of control variates are considered.},

The set of distributions are combined into a labeled mixture, with the mixture weights depending on the initial estimates of log normalizing constants (or free energies). Then, observations are generated by Markov transitions, and free energy estimates are adjusted online by stochastic approximation. We propose two stochastic approximation schemes by Rao\textendash Blackwellization of the scheme commonly used, and derive the optimal choice of a gain matrix, resulting in the minimum asymptotic variance for free energy estimation, in a simple and feasible form. Second, we develop an offline method, locally weighted histogram analysis, for estimating free energies and expectations, using all the simulated data from multiple distributions by either self-adjusted mixture sampling or other sampling algorithms. This method can be computationally much faster, with little sacrifice of statistical efficiency, than a global method currently used, especially when a large number of distributions are involved.

  abstract = {Adaptive multilevel splitting (AMS) is a rare event sampling method that requires minimal parameter tuning and allows unbiased sampling of transition pathways of a given rare event. Previous simulation studies have verified the efficiency and accuracy of AMS in the calculation of transition times for simple systems in both Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Now, AMS is applied for the first time to an MD simulation of protein\textendash ligand dissociation, representing a leap in complexity from the previous test cases. Of interest is the dissociation rate, which is typically too low to be accessible to conventional MD. The present study joins other recent efforts to develop advanced sampling techniques in MD to calculate dissociation rates, which are gaining importance in the pharmaceutical field as indicators of drug efficacy. The system investigated here, benzamidine bound to trypsin, is an example common to many of these efforts. The AMS estimate of the dissociation rate was found to be (2.6 {$\pm$} 2.4) \texttimes{} 102 s\textendash 1, which compares well with the experimental value.},

  abstract = {This article addresses calculations of the standard free energy of binding from molecular simulations in which a bound ligand is extracted from its binding site by steered molecular dynamics (MD) simulations or equilibrium umbrella sampling (US). Host\textendash guest systems are used as test beds to examine the requirements for obtaining the reversible work of ligand extraction. We find that, for both steered MD and US, marked irreversibilities can occur when the guest molecule crosses an energy barrier and suddenly jumps to a new position, causing dissipation of energy stored in the stretched molecule(s). For flexible molecules, this occurs even when a stiff pulling spring is used, and it is difficult to suppress in calculations where the spring is attached to the molecules by single, fixed attachment points. We, therefore, introduce and test a method, fluctuation-guided pulling, which adaptively adjusts the spring's attachment points based on the guest's atomic fluctuations relative to the host. This adaptive approach is found to substantially improve the reversibility of both steered MD and US calculations for the present systems. The results are then used to estimate standard binding free energies within a comprehensive framework, termed attach-pull-release, which recognizes that the standard free energy of binding must include not only the pulling work itself, but also the work of attaching and then releasing the spring, where the release work includes an accounting of the standard concentration to which the ligand is discharged. \textcopyright{} 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Previously, the X-ray crystal structure of {$\beta$}2AR has been determined in complex with two partial inverse agonists, but the global impact of additional ligands on the structure or local impacts on the binding site are not well-understood. To assess the extent of such ligand-induced conformational differences, we determined the crystal structures of a previously described engineered {$\beta$}2AR construct in complex with two inverse agonists: ICI 118,551 (2.8 \AA ), a recently described compound (2.8 \AA ) (Kolb et al, 2009), and the antagonist alprenolol (3.1 \AA ). The structures show the same overall fold observed for the previous {$\beta$}2AR structures and demonstrate that the ligand binding site can accommodate compounds of different chemical and pharmacological properties with only minor local structural rearrangements. All three compounds contain a hydroxy-amine motif that establishes a conserved hydrogen bond network with the receptor and chemically diverse aromatic moieties that form distinct interactions with {$\beta$}2AR. Furthermore, receptor ligand cross-docking experiments revealed that a single {$\beta$}2AR complex can be suitable for docking of a range of antagonists and inverse agonists but also indicate that additional ligand-receptor structures may be useful to further improve performance for in-silico docking or lead-optimization in drug design.},

  abstract = {The absolute (standard) binding free energy of eight FK506-related ligands to FKBP12 is calculated using free energy perturbation molecular dynamics (FEP/MD) simulations with explicit solvent. A number of features are implemented to improve the accuracy and enhance the convergence of the calculations. First, the absolute binding free energy is decomposed into sequential steps during which the ligand-surrounding interactions as well as various biasing potentials restraining the translation, orientation, and conformation of the ligand are turned ``on'' and ``off.'' Second, sampling of the ligand conformation is enforced by a restraining potential based on the root mean-square deviation relative to the bound state conformation. The effect of all the restraining potentials is rigorously unbiased, and it is shown explicitly that the final results are independent of all artificial restraints. Third, the repulsive and dispersive free energy contribution arising from the Lennard-Jones interactions of the ligand with its surrounding (protein and solvent) is calculated using the Weeks-Chandler-Andersen separation. This separation also improves convergence of the FEP/MD calculations. Fourth, to decrease the computational cost, only a small number of atoms in the vicinity of the binding site are simulated explicitly, while all the influence of the remaining atoms is incorporated implicitly using the generalized solvent boundary potential (GSBP) method. With GSBP, the size of the simulated FKBP12/ligand systems is significantly reduced, from {$\sim$}25,000 to 2500. The computations are very efficient and the statistical error is small ({$\sim$}1kcal/mol). The calculated binding free energies are generally in good agreement with available experimental data and previous calculations (within {$\sim$}2kcal/mol). The present results indicate that a strategy based on FEP/MD simulations of a reduced GSBP atomic model sampled with conformational, translational, and orientational restraining potentials can be computationally inexpensive and accurate.},

  abstract = {Biological processes often depend on protein\textendash ligand binding events, yet accurate calculation of the associated energetics remains as a significant challenge of central importance to structure-based drug design. Recently, we have proposed that the displacement of unfavorable waters by the ligand, replacing them with groups complementary to the protein surface, is the principal driving force for protein\textendash ligand binding, and we have introduced the WaterMap method to account this effect. However, in spite of the adage ``nature abhors vacuum,'' one can occasionally observe situations in which a portion of the receptor active site is so unfavorable for water molecules that a void is formed there. In this paper, we demonstrate that the presence of dry regions in the receptor has a nontrivial effect on ligand binding affinity, and suggest that such regions may represent a general motif for molecular recognition between the dry region in the receptor and the hydrophobic groups in the ligands. With the introduction of a term attributable to the occupation of the dry regions by ligand atoms, combined with the WaterMap calculation, we obtain excellent agreement with experiment for the prediction of relative binding affinities for a number of congeneric ligand series binding to the major urinary protein receptor. In addition, WaterMap when combined with the cavity contribution is more predictive than at least one specific implementation [Abel R, Young T, Farid R, Berne BJ, Friesner RA (2008) J Am Chem Soc 130:2817\textendash 2831] of the popular MM-GBSA approach to binding affinity calculation.},

The second case, consisting of two neutral thrombin ligands that are taken from a recent medicinal chemistry program for this interesting pharmaceutical target, is of particular significance in that it demonstrates that good results can be obtained for large, complex ligands, as opposed to relatively simple model systems. To achieve quantitative agreement with experiment in the thrombin case, a next generation force field, Optimized Potentials for Liquid Simulations 2.0, is required, which provides superior charges and torsional parameters as compared to earlier alternatives.},

Over the past few decades, free-energy calculations have benefited from improved force fields and sampling algorithms, as well as the advent of low-cost parallel computing. However, it has proven to be challenging to reliably achieve the level of accuracy that would be needed to guide lead optimization ({$\sim$}5\texttimes{} in binding affinity) for a wide range of ligands and protein targets. Not surprisingly, widespread commercial application of free-energy simulations has been limited due to the lack of large-scale validation coupled with the technical challenges traditionally associated with running these types of calculations. Here, we report an approach that achieves an unprecedented level of accuracy across a broad range of target classes and ligands, with retrospective results encompassing 200 ligands and a wide variety of chemical perturbations, many of which involve significant changes in ligand chemical structures. In addition, we have applied the method in prospective drug discovery projects and found a significant improvement in the quality of the compounds synthesized that have been predicted to be potent. Compounds predicted to be potent by this approach have a substantial reduction in false positives relative to compounds synthesized on the basis of other computational or medicinal chemistry approaches. Furthermore, the results are consistent with those obtained from our retrospective studies, demonstrating the robustness and broad range of applicability of this approach, which can be used to drive decisions in lead optimization.},

  abstract = {The accurate prediction of protein\textendash ligand binding free energies remains a significant challenge of central importance in computational biophysics and structure-based drug design. Multiple recent advances including the development of greatly improved protein and ligand molecular mechanics force fields, more efficient enhanced sampling methods, and low-cost powerful GPU computing clusters have enabled accurate and reliable predictions of relative protein\textendash ligand binding free energies through the free energy perturbation (FEP) methods. However, the existing FEP methods can only be used to calculate the relative binding free energies for R-group modifications or single-atom modifications and cannot be used to efficiently evaluate scaffold hopping modifications to a lead molecule. Scaffold hopping or core hopping, a very common design strategy in drug discovery projects, is critical not only in the early stages of a discovery campaign where novel active matter must be identified but also in lead optimization where the resolution of a variety of ADME/Tox problems may require identification of a novel core structure. In this paper, we introduce a method that enables theoretically rigorous, yet computationally tractable, relative protein\textendash ligand binding free energy calculations to be pursued for scaffold hopping modifications. We apply the method to six pharmaceutically interesting cases where diverse types of scaffold hopping modifications were required to identify the drug molecules ultimately sent into the clinic. For these six diverse cases, the predicted binding affinities were in close agreement with experiment, demonstrating the wide applicability and the significant impact Core Hopping FEP may provide in drug discovery projects.},

  abstract = {A general methodology for calculating the equilibrium binding constant of a flexible ligand to a protein receptor is formulated on the basis of potentials of mean force. The overall process is decomposed into several stages that can be computed separately: the free ligand in the bulk is first restrained into the conformation it adopts in the bound state, position, and orientation by applying biasing potentials, then it is translated into the binding site, where it is released completely. The conformational restraining potential is based on the root-mean-square deviation of the peptide coordinates relative to its average conformation in the bound complex. Free energy contributions from each stage are calculated by means of free energy perturbation potential of mean force techniques by using appropriate order parameters. The present approach avoids the need to decouple the ligand from its surrounding (bulk solvent and receptor protein) as is traditionally performed in the double-decoupling scheme. It is believed that the present formulation will be particularly useful when the solvation free energy of the ligand is very large. As an application, the equilibrium binding constant of the phosphotyrosine peptide pYEEI to the Src homology 2 domain of human Lck has been calculated. The results are in good agreement with experimental values.},

  abstract = {The calculation of relative free energies that involve large reorganizations of the environment is one of the great challenges of condensed-phase simulation. Such calculations are of particular importance in protein-ligand free-energy calculations. To meet this challenge, we have developed new free-energy techniques that combine the advantages of the replica-exchange method with free-energy perturbation (FEP) and finite-difference thermodynamic integration (FDTI). These new techniques are tested and compared with FEP, FDTI, and the adaptive umbrella weighted histogram analysis method (AdUmWHAM) on the challenging calculation of the relative hydration free energy of methane and water. This calculation involves a large solvent configurational change. Through the use of replica-exchange moves along the {$\lambda$}-coordinate, the configurations sampled along {$\lambda$} are allowed to mix, which leads to dramatic improvements in solvent configurational sampling, an efficient reduction of random sampling error, and a reduction of general simulation error. This is achieved at effectively no extra computational cost, relative to standard FEP or FDTI.},

  abstract = {We consider staged free-energy calculation methods in the context of phase-space overlap relations, and argue that the selection of work-based methods should be guided by consideration of the phase-space overlap of the systems of interest. Stages should always be constructed such that work is performed only into a system that has a phase-space subset relation with the starting system. Thus multiple stages are required if the systems of interest are not such that one forms a phase-space subset with the other. Three two-stage methods are possible, termed umbrella sampling, overlap sampling, and funnel sampling. The last is appropriate for cases in which the subset relation holds, but only in the extreme, meaning that one system's important phase space constitutes a very small portion of the others. Umbrella sampling is most suitable for nonoverlap systems, and overlap sampling is appropriate for systems exhibiting partial phase-space overlap. We review recently introduced metrics that characterize phase-space overlap, showing that the performance of the single- and two-stage methods is consistent with the phase-space picture. We also demonstrate that a recently introduced bias-detection measure is effective in identifying inaccuracy in single- and multistage calculations. The examples used are the chemical-potential calculation for a Lennard-Jones liquid at moderate and at high densities, the same for model water at ambient conditions, and a process of charging a neutral ion in water.},

The second measure is based on information theory, and defines two relative entropies which are conveniently expressed in terms of the dissipated work for free-energy perturbation (FEP) calculations in the A\textrightarrow BA\textrightarrow B{$<$}math display="inline" overflow="scroll" altimg="eq-00015.gif"{$><$}mrow{$><$}mi{$>$}A{$<$}/mi{$><$}mo{$>\rightarrow <$}/mo{$><$}mi{$>$}B{$<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/math{$>$} and B\textrightarrow AB\textrightarrow A{$<$}math display="inline" overflow="scroll" altimg="eq-00016.gif"{$><$}mrow{$><$}mi{$>$}B{$<$}/mi{$><$}mo{$>\rightarrow <$}/mo{$><$}mi{$>$}A{$<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/math{$>$} directions, respectively. Phase-space overlap is an important consideration in the performance of free-energy calculations. To demonstrate this connection, we examine bias in FEP calculations applied to a system of independent particles in a harmonic potential. Systems are selected to represent a range of overlap situations, including extreme subset, subset, partial overlap, and nonoverlap. The magnitude and symmetry of the bias (A\textrightarrow BA\textrightarrow B{$<$}math display="inline" overflow="scroll" altimg="eq-00017.gif"{$><$}mrow{$><$}mi{$>$}A{$<$}/mi{$><$}mo{$>\rightarrow <$}/mo{$><$}mi{$>$}B{$<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/math{$>$} vs B\textrightarrow AB\textrightarrow A{$<$}math display="inline" overflow="scroll" altimg="eq-00018.gif"{$><$}mrow{$><$}mi{$>$}B{$<$}/mi{$><$}mo{$>\rightarrow <$}/mo{$><$}mi{$>$}A{$<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/math{$>$}) are shown to correlate well with the overlap, and consequently with the overlap measures. The relative entropies are used to scale the amount of sampling to obtain a universal bias curve. This result leads to develop a simple heuristic that can be applied to determine whether a work-based free-energy measurement is free of bias. The heuristic is based in part on the measured free energy, but we argue that it is fail-safe inasmuch as any bias in the measurement will not promote a false indication of accuracy.},

In contrast to the weighted histogram analysis method (WHAM), dTRAM does not require data to be sampled from global equilibrium, and can thus produce superior estimates for enhanced sampling data such as parallel/simulated tempering, replica exchange, umbrella sampling, or metadynamics. In addition, dTRAM provides optimal estimates of Markov state models (MSMs) from the discretized state-space trajectories at all thermodynamic states. Under suitable conditions, these MSMs can be used to calculate kinetic quantities (e.g., rates, timescales). In the limit of a single thermodynamic state, dTRAM estimates a maximum likelihood reversible MSM, while in the limit of uncorrelated sampling data, dTRAM is identical to WHAM. dTRAM is thus a generalization to both estimators.},

The calculated pairwise free energy difference is either directly adopted or transformed to absolute binding free energy for molecule rank ordering. We investigated, through both analytic derivations and simulations, how the selection of pairs in the experiment could impact the overall prediction precision. Our studies showed that (1) the estimated absolute binding free energy () derived from calculated pairwise differences ({$\Delta\Delta$}G) through weighted least squares fitting is more precise in prediction than the pairwise difference values when the number of pairs is more than the number of ligands and (2) prediction precision is influenced by both the total number of pairs and the specifically selected pairs, the latter being critically important when the number of calculated pairs is limited. Furthermore, we applied optimal experimental design in pair selection and found that the optimally selected pairs can outperform randomly selected pairs in prediction precision. In an illustrative example, we showed that, upon weighing ligand structure similarity into design optimization, the weighted optimal designs are more efficient than the literature reported designs. This work provides a new approach to assess retrospective pairwise-based prediction results, and a method to design new prospective pairwise-based experiments for molecular lead optimization. \textcopyright{} 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract = {The ability to computationally predict protein-small molecule binding affinities with high accuracy would accelerate drug discovery and reduce its cost by eliminating rounds of trial-and-error synthesis and experimental evaluation of candidate ligands. As academic and industrial groups work toward this capability, there is an ongoing need for datasets that can be used to rigorously test new computational methods. Although protein\textendash ligand data are clearly important for this purpose, their size and complexity make it difficult to obtain well-converged results and to troubleshoot computational methods. Host\textendash guest systems offer a valuable alternative class of test cases, as they exemplify noncovalent molecular recognition but are far smaller and simpler. As a consequence, host\textendash guest systems have been part of the prior two rounds of SAMPL prediction exercises, and they also figure in the present SAMPL5 round. In addition to being blinded, and thus avoiding biases that may arise in retrospective studies, the SAMPL challenges have the merit of focusing multiple researchers on a common set of molecular systems, so that methods may be compared and ideas exchanged. The present paper provides an overview of the host\textendash guest component of SAMPL5, which centers on three different hosts, two octa-acids and a glycoluril-based molecular clip, and two different sets of guest molecules, in aqueous solution. A range of methods were applied, including electronic structure calculations with implicit solvent models; methods that combine empirical force fields with implicit solvent models; and explicit solvent free energy simulations. The most reliable methods tend to fall in the latter class, consistent with results in prior SAMPL rounds, but the level of accuracy is still below that sought for reliable computer-aided drug design. Advances in force field accuracy, modeling of protonation equilibria, electronic structure methods, and solvent models, hold promise for future improvements.},

  abstract = {Macrocycles have been emerging as a very important drug class in the past few decades largely due to their expanded chemical diversity benefiting from advances in synthetic methods. Macrocyclization has been recognized as an effective way to restrict the conformational space of acyclic small molecule inhibitors with the hope of improving potency, selectivity, and metabolic stability. Because of their relatively larger size as compared to typical small molecule drugs and the complexity of the structures, efficient sampling of the accessible macrocycle conformational space and accurate prediction of their binding affinities to their target protein receptors poses a great challenge of central importance in computational macrocycle drug design. In this article, we present a novel method for relative binding free energy calculations between macrocycles with different ring sizes and between the macrocycles and their corresponding acyclic counterparts. We have applied the method to seven pharmaceutically interesting data sets taken from recent drug discovery projects including 33 macrocyclic ligands covering a diverse chemical space. The predicted binding free energies are in good agreement with experimental data with an overall root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.94 kcal/mol. This is to our knowledge the first time where the free energy of the macrocyclization of linear molecules has been directly calculated with rigorous physics-based free energy calculation methods, and we anticipate the outstanding accuracy demonstrated here across a broad range of target classes may have significant implications for macrocycle drug discovery.},

  abstract = {The aim of docking is to accurately predict the structure of a ligand within the constraints of a receptor binding site and to correctly estimate the strength of binding. We discuss, in detail, methodological developments that occurred in the docking field in 2010 and 2011, with a particular focus on the more difficult, and sometimes controversial, aspects of this promising computational discipline. The main developments in docking in this period, covered in this review, are receptor flexibility, solvation, fragment docking, postprocessing, docking into homology models, and docking comparisons. Several new, or at least newly invigorated, advances occurred in areas such as nonlinear scoring functions, using machine-learning approaches. This review is strongly focused on docking advances in the context of drug design, specifically in virtual screening and fragment-based drug design. Where appropriate, we refer readers to exemplar case studies. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},
